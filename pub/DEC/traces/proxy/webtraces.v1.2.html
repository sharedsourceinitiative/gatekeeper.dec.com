<P><H1>Digital's Web Proxy Traces (V1.2 format)</H1>
 This document begins by offering a quick
introduction to using web proxy traces that were taken at Digital
Equipment Corporation, and then discusses these
traces in greater detail.

<P><H3>Changes in V1.2</H3>
One field was added to the trace-record format (the url field),
and one new flag bit was defined.

<P><H3> A Quick Introduction </H3> 
<P> The key things you need to know to work with these traces are:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> Current Traces </STRONG> -- Currently available is one set of traces taken over a period of a few weeks, including approximately 24,477,674
references.  These traces are from an
instrumented version of the <A
HREF="http://www.nlanr.net/Squid">squid</A> proxy, and record
all external web requests generated from within Digital Equipment
Corporation during that period.

    </UL>


<LI><STRONG> Post-processing </STRONG> -- After collection the trace
data was post-processed.  The goal of this post-processing was to
transform  four of the larger more unwieldy fields (server's name,
URL's path, query [if any], and client's IP address) into  four simple 32 bit
integers.  This transformation was done to allow easy manipulation of
trace records, and to maintain privacy.
    <UL>
    <LI> More on <A HREF="#post">post-processing</A> 
    </UL>


<LI> <STRONG> Trace Files </STRONG> -- Each trace file starts with an 8 KB
ASCII text header, with
details of the post-processing including total counts for the number of
unique clients, servers, URL paths, URL queries, and total number of
events. This header is then followed by trace event records stored as
binary data.  (Note: these traces were processed on an Alpha, a little
endian machine.)
    <UL> 
    <LI> More on <A HREF="#header">trace file headers</A> 
    </UL>


<LI><STRONG> Record Fields </STRONG> -- The following items are
available in each trace event record:
<UL>
<LI> the time at which the request was seen
<LI> the duration of the request
<LI> the amount of time the proxy spent communicating with the server
</UL>
all in microseconds, and
<UL>
<LI> the object's last-modified date, if available
<LI> a unique integer ID for the client
<LI> a unique integer ID for the server
<LI> the server port number
<LI> a unique integer ID for the path
<LI> a unique integer ID for the query, if any
<LI> a unique integer ID for the complete url
<LI> a code specifying the object type (based on the path name extension,
if any)
<LI> the object size in bytes
<LI> the method used
<LI> the protocol used
</UL>
All of these fields are encoded as integers of various sizes.

<CODE><STRONG>proxytrace2txt_v2</STRONG></CODE></A>, as a tool to
convert the trace files into human-readable form, and as a

Taken </A> </H3> 
<P>
We modified the 1.0.beta17 version of the squid proxy to output
specific details of its actions at various points. This instrumented
proxy software was then used on two machines that act as web proxies
for the Digital's internal network.
Because the DNS entry for the proxy was set up so that the DNS servers
would randomly return either of the two addresses with equal probability,
proxy clients split their requests between the two proxies.
The trace stream
represented in these files is a combination of requests traced at both
machines, and thus represents all external web-related requests
generated from within Digital.
<P>
During the time covered by these traces, the proxy software was NOT
operating as a cache.

<P> <H3> <A NAME="post"> Post-processing of the Traces</A> </H3> <P>In
post-processing the instrumented proxy output, the following steps
were taken:
 <OL>
 <LI><strong> parse </STRONG>-- Individual events from the
instrumented proxy (e.g. <CODE>###time_stamp### accept TCP connection
from client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</CODE>)
were correlated to generate an intermediate format with
one line for each client request.
<LI><STRONG> clean </STRONG>-- Four fields were converted from
strings (or IP addresses) to unique ID numbers (32 bit integers). In
this conversion, a keyed MD5 fingerprint of the string is made and
stored.  This fingerprint can then the used to correlate specific
field values across trace sets. The files containing the mapping from
unique IDs to 128 bit fingerprints are available as well.  This step
was also taken to protect the privacy of internal web activity;
we will not make available the mappings between the original strings
or addresses and the MD5 fingerprints.
<UL>
<LI>More
details are discussed in  <A  HREF = "#hash">Unique ID  &amp;
fingerprint</A>
</UL>

 <LI><STRONG> text to binary conversion </STRONG>-- This last step
takes what has been up to now ASCII text data and writes it as binary data,
preceded by an 8 KB header containing a summary of the previous
steps, as well as cumulative count information and a trace version number.
 </OL>
 
<P><H3>   <A  NAME = "hash">Unique ID  &amp; fingerprint</A> </H3>
As explained above, four fields are converted to unique ID numbers.
These numbers simply represent an enumeration of the values seen for
that field.  For example, if the first value seen for the server field
is www.Joe_server.com, then this value will have the unique ID number
of 1, and every time a request to this server is seen the server 
number  field will have the value 1.  Although a trace set may be kept
in several files (usually one file per day) these unique ID numbers are
consistent across an entire set of traces.

<P>Additionally, when these fields are transformed to unique IDs a 128
bit fingerprint is used to specifically identify the string.
(see <A HREF="#fields">Trace Fields and Values</A> for more details on
the string representing these fields).  Files mapping each fingerprint
to each unique ID number are also available. The purpose of these
files is to allow correlation between different trace sets without
compromising the specifics (or privacy) of the site traced's references.

<!--
<P> This transformation and fingerprinting is done by one program
(<CODE>clean</CODE>) that takes a space separated text column from an
ASCII text file and does the conversion.
-->

<P> <H3><A NAME = "header">Trace File Header</A> </H3> <P> The ASCII
text header for each file details the output from post-processing.
Each such header contains the maximum value that each of the
unique IDs has reached in this trace file. This number is basically a
count of the total number of values seen for that field in the traced
stream ending with this file. For example, if the client field has a
maximum of 100, then we can say that by the end of this trace file, the
entire stream traced has seen requests from 100 different clients.


<P> <H3><A  NAME = "fields">Trace Fields and Values</A> </H3>
<P> The structure of each trace record is shown in the type definition
below.  The type <CODE>u_4bytes</CODE> is an unsigned four byte integer.

<P>
All fields are written in little-endian byte-order (this work was done
using Digital's Alpha-based systems).  It should be possible to
read these files on a big-endian system, by using macros or function
calls to byte-swap the 16-bit or 32-bit fields, as appropriate.
 
<PRE>
    typedef struct  _TEntry_v2 {
	u_4bytes			event_duration;
	u_4bytes			server_duration;
	u_4bytes			last_mod;
	u_4bytes			time_sec;
	u_4bytes			time_usec;

	u_4bytes			client;
	u_4bytes			server;
	u_4bytes			port;
	u_4bytes			path;
	u_4bytes			query;
	u_4bytes			size;

	u_4bytes			url;

	unsigned short			status;
	unsigned  char			type;
	unsigned  char			flags;
 	method_t			method;
	protocol_t			protocol;
    } TEntry;
</PRE>

<P>The duration  fields  are measured in microseconds. The event
duration is the time from when the proxy first accepts a connection
from the client to when the proxy successfully closes that connection.
The server_duration field consists of the time the proxy is connected to the
web server.  Note this duration can take the unsigned equivalent of -1
in the case that no connection to this server was made.

<P> The time fields represent the time at which the proxy accepted a
connection from the client, in microseconds since the UNIX epoch.

<P>The fields client, server, path, query are all unique ID numbers.
These numbers are sequential from 1 to the last unique value for  that
field.
 
<P>
The ``path'' is the portion of the requested URL following the server
name (and possible port number), up to the end of the URL or the first
<CODE>?</CODE>, if one appears.
If the URL contains no path, a default path ID is used,
of <CODE>/</CODE> is used  and a flag is set (see
<A HREF="#flags">below</A>.)

<P>
If a <CODE>?</CODE> appears in the URL, the string used for the query
is everything after (and including) the
first <CODE>?</CODE> in the URL.

<P>The port is the TCP port used for the connection.
<P>The size is the size of the object in bytes.
<P>
The url number is simply a
unique number for each distinct (host, path, query)
combination. This saves having to do explicit comparisons of these
three fields during trace processing.
<P>Status is the HTTP status code returned from the web server.

<P><H3><A NAME="code">Code to Read Traces</A> </H3>
 <P>The <A HREF="./codev2/proxytrace2txt_v2.c"><CODE>proxytrace2txt_v2</CODE></A>
program is a simple C program (with an associated <A HREF="
./codev2/proxytrace2txt_v2.h">header</A> file) that opens either a regular
or compressed (file with extension ".gz") trace data file, and prints
out the trace records as seen.  A packaged copy of the <A
HREF="./codev2/proxytrace2txt_v2.tar.gz">code</A> for this program is provided as a
 tool to examine the trace data, and as a template from which to
develop simulation programs that use this data.
(Note that this version of the software runs only on little-endian
machines.)

<P>
As noted above, these traces were created on a little-endian machine.
<A HREF="mailto:rousskov@plains.NoDak.edu">Alex Rousskov</A> has kindly
contributed a modified program,
<A HREF="./contrib/proxytrace2any.tar.gz">proxytrace2any</A>,
that does automatic byte-order conversion.  This program also supports
both the V1.0 and V1.2 input formats, supports three output formats
(DEC native, squid, and squid with swapped fields). New formats can be
easily added.  See the
<A HREF="./contrib/README.proxytrace2any">README</A> file for more
