<P><H1>Digital's Web Proxy Traces: Currently Available Traces
V1.0 format</H1>

<BLINK>WARNING:</BLINK> The files that were present here until
February 7, 1997 were produced by slightly buggy software, and
had an incorrect mapping between UIDs and the underlying values.
If you have already retrieved files from this data set, and
did not see this warning before retrieving the files, then you
probably have bogus data.
We apologize for any problems caused by these errors.
<P>
The current traces contain data taken
between 29 August 1996 and 22 September 96.  (Some traces may not
cover entire days.)
This is a total of approximately 24,477,674 references.
<P>
For a subset of the references including only those references from clients
that were within a short distance of the proxy where the trace
was made, see the
<A HREF="locallistv1.2.html">subset traces</A>.
<P>
Each day's data is in a separate file (the sizes given are for the
compressed form of the file):

The "headers" file for each trace contains statistics about the trace,
including the number of references.
<P>
In addition, we provide files mapping between the unique IDs (UIDs)
in these traces, and keyed-MD5 signatures of the orginal fields.
These mappings may be useful, in the future,
for correlating between traces from different sites.

Map between keyed-MD5 fingerprint of client addresses and UIDs</A>

<LI><A HREF="./host.MD5to_uid.gz">

</UL>
Note: some of these mapping files are quite large!
<P>
The complete set of traces
is about 526 MBytes; the complete set of mapping files is about 107 MBytes.
<P>
We will not release the original mapping between these fields and
keyed-MD5 signatures, nor will we release the MD5 key.  Please do
not ask.
<P>
For information about file formats, etc., please see the
<A HREF="./webtraces.html">documentation</A>.
<P>
In addition to the trace files listed here, we have another
set of files that cover the same trace but with a few additional
fields.  These are listed as the
<A HREF="./tracelist.html">V1.2 format trace files</A>, 
and their format is described in the
<A HREF="./webtraces.v1.2.html">documentation for the V1.2 format</A>.
