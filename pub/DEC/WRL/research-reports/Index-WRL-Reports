	*************************************

Ftp information: All the reports and notes listed in this directory
are in postscript compressed form. The format "WRL-TR" refers to all
technical reports and the format "WRL-TN" refers to all technical
notes.  In other words, "WRL-TR-86.1.ps.Z" refers to the postscript
compressed form of tech report 86/1. If you have questions about the
files in this directory send a message to "gw-admin@pa.dec.com".

Technical notes are for rapid distribution of technical material.  Usually 
this represents work in progress.  Our technical reports may include large 
portions of prior technical notes. 

We have a technical report server from which you can also retrieve
reports and notes (in hard copy and postscript), as well as receive
abstracts of the reports or get added to our mailing list. Send a
message to the server with "help" in the subject line for information
on how to use it. If you would like to obtain a hard copy of any of
the reports or notes, send a subject line similar to "order 89/2 90/1".
Be sure to include your postal mail address. The reports will be mailed 
out to you withing a couple of weeks. Send server requests to 
wrl-techreports@pa.dec.com, or
