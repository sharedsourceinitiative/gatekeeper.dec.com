    THIS IS NOT A RUNNING SYSTEM.  JUST A BUNCH OF FILES THAT WON'T COMPILE.

    This file contains an incomplete version of magic, containing some 
    useful code from DECWRL.  The most useful feature is the ability to
    do DRC on CIF layers, thereby allowing DRC to use boolean AND and OR 
    operations.  There are a few other useful mods.
