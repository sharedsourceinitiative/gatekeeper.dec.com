                      Atom V2.59 Release Notes
                      ========================

	*****************************************************************
	*								*
	*	The Atom ADK is no longer supported for the 3.2x        *
	*	versions of Digital Unix.				*
	*								*
	*****************************************************************


Digital Unix is now called Tru64 Unix.  This note has been updated to 
reflect that change.

A few problems have been fixed and some new support added since the 
Atom 2.57 ADK:

    Modifications to Atom:

     -  A line number problem with large C++ applications has been fixed.

     -  A scoping problem in the local symbol table was fixed.

     -  The cause of an assertion in the trampoline table support has been 
	fixed.


    Modifications to Hiprof:

     -  A new -samples mode is now supported in Hiprof: -toolargs=-samples

      	This causes hiprof to profile CPU-time in all selected code using 
	profil(2).  The resulting profile is a statistical sampling rather 
	than a measurement, but it reflects the memory access delays suffered 
	by the program, and it is usefully accurate when the run-time is more 
	than a few seconds (the longer the better). The -asm, -heavy, and 
	-lines options of gprof(1) can be used to display more finely grained 
	profiles at the level of source-lines and machine-instructions.

     -  Hiprof's -cputime mode is no longer supported for threaded programs,
	because the mapping of the RPCC clock from kernel threads to pthreads
	can not be achieved reliably. Use -samples instead; it is now the 
	default profiling technique for the hiprof(1) command.


This ADK contains the newly structured third degree as the default.  Using 
"atom -tool third" will use the new third.  If you should experience a crash 
or hang, please send stack traces with both -g and -gp to atombugs@zk3.dec.com.
To use the old third, set ATOMTOOLPATH to /usr/lib/cmplrs/atom/old_third.

Atom is now divided into two kits.  The ATM400 kit can be installed on 
Tru64 UNIX V4.0x.  The ATM500 kit can be installed on Tru64 Unix 5.0.
Choose the kit that is right for your system.

Compaq Internal Base-Level Support:
ATM500 kit is supported for Tru64 UNIX Steel BL16 or later.  It is not 
supported on Steel BL15 or earlier Steel releases.

ATM400 kit is supported for all V4.0x systems, including PTFC.

Kit Availability
================

There are three Atom kits, each consists of a single, tar'ed setld package.  
You only need one of these kits, depending on what version of the operating 
system you have.  Use the ATM400 kit for installation on Tru64 UNIX V4.0x.
Use the ATM500 kit for installation on Tru64 UNIX V5.0.  The ADK is no 
longer supported on Digital Unix 3.2x.  However, the last kit that was 
available for that platform, 2.43, can be obtained at the two locations 
listed below.  The kit name is ATM350.tar, and the release notes are called 
README350.


You can obtain these kits from one of two locations.  All Compaq
employees should have anonymous ftp access to this location in Nashua,
NH (USA):

	system:  	alpha.zk3.dec.com

	directory:	/usr/ftp/pub/prof/tools/atom

	files:     	README    	- These release notes
			ADK_NOTES	- A compilation of previous changes
			ATM400.tar	- Atom kit for Unix V4.0x
			ATM500.tar	- Atom kit for Unix V5.0


You may copy the kit from this location with this command:

	% ftp alpha.zk3.dec.com
	Name: anonymous
	Password: <your email address>

	ftp> cd pub/prof/tools/atom
	ftp> bin
	ftp> get ATM400.tar

Everyone (including non-Compaq people) should have anonymous ftp access
to this location in Palo Alto, CA (USA):

	system:  	gatekeeper.pa.dec.com

	directory:	/pub/DEC/WRL/lueck

	files:     	README    	- These release notes
			ADK_NOTES	- A compilation of previous changes
			ATM400.tar	- Atom kit for Unix V4.0x
			ATM500.tar	- Atom kit for Unix V5.0

You may copy the kit from this location with this command:

	% ftp gatekeeper.pa.dec.com
	Name: anonymous
	Password: <your email address>

	ftp> cd pub/DEC/WRL/lueck
	ftp> bin
	ftp> get ATM400.tar

For security reasons, read permission has been turned *off* in the
directory containing these files.  You can still copy the files, but you
will not be able to list the contents of the directory.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This Atom kit can be installed on the following revisions of the
Tru64 UNIX (formerly known as DEC OSF/1) operating system:

	V4.0    (Platinum)
	V4.0A	(PTA)
	V4.0B	(PTB)
	V4.0C
	V4.0D	(PTmin)
	V4.0E	(PTEV6)
	V4.0F	(PTFC)
	V5.0	(Steel BL16 or later)

It may not be installed on earlier revisions.  Note, installation on Tru64
UNIX V4.0x requires the ATM400 kit.  Installation on Tru64 UNIX 5.0
requires the ATM500 kit.



Installing on Tru64 UNIX V4.0x
--------------------------------

Before installing this kit, make sure you remove any previous versions
of Atom:

	% su
	# setld -d ATMBASE400

If this command returns an error, don't worry.  That simply means you
don't have an old version of the Atom kit installed, no harm has been
done.

    NOTE: Do *not* delete the OSFATMBASE or OSFATMBIN subsets.  These
	subsets are unrelated to Atom.

    Note:  If you are deleting the old kit, but _not_ installing a new 
	Atom ADK, you may need to set up symbolic links for the new drivers.  
	Execute the following commands:
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/hiprof /usr/bin/hiprof
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/pixie /usr/bin/pixie
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/third /usr/bin/third

	This is only necessary if you are _not_ installing a new kit.

	
You are now ready to install the new kit.  First, copy the kit as
described above.  Then unpack the kit into a temporary directory on your
system:

	% cd <temp directory>
	% tar xf ATM400.tar

Now, become root and install the kit.  Because the installation may
replace some system files, you should not install this kit on a system
with other users loged on.

	% su
	# setld -l .

This displays a menu of possible subsets to install.  There is only one
subset to choose.  Your operating system already has all the necessary
support for Atom.

	ATMBASE400	- The base Atom functionality.  You must install
	           	  this subset.

After you install the Atom kit, you may delete the temporary directory
where you unpacked the kit:

	% rm -rf <temp directory>

There is no need to reboot the system after installing this subset.

You may also wish to run the installation verification programs.
However, make sure you have a fair amount of /tmp space.  If not, set
the TMPDIR environment variable to point to a larger partition (for
example, /usr/tmp).

        % su
        # setld -v ATMBASE400

The verification program passes if it prints the following line:

        Confidence test suite passed.


Uninstalling from Tru64 UNIX V4.0
-----------------------------------

Should you want to remove the ATM400 kit from a Tru64 UNIX V4.0 system
and revert to the original version of Atom, you can follow this
procedure:

	% su
	# setld -d ATMBASE400




Installing on Tru64 UNIX V5.0
-------------------------------

Before installing this kit, make sure you remove any previous versions
of Atom:

	% su
	# setld -d ATMBASE500

If this command returns an error, don't worry.  That simply means you
don't have an old version of the Atom kit installed, no harm has been
done.

    NOTE: Do *not* delete the OSFATMBASE or OSFATMBIN subsets.  These
	subsets are unrelated to Atom.

    Note:  If you are deleting the old kit, but _not_ installing a new 
	Atom ADK, you may need to set up symbolic links for the new drivers.  
	Execute the following commands:
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/hiprof /usr/bin/hiprof
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/pixie /usr/bin/pixie
	ln -s /usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/third /usr/bin/third

	This is only necessary if you are _not_ installing a new kit.


You are now ready to install the new kit.  First, copy the kit as
described above.  Then unpack the kit into a temporary directory on your
system:

	% cd <temp directory>
	% tar xf ATM500.tar

Now, become root and install the kit.  Because the installation may
replace some system files, you should not install this kit on a system
with other users logged on.

	% su
	# setld -l .

This displays a menu of possible subsets to install.  There is only one
subset to choose.  Your operating system already has all the necessary
support for Atom.

	ATMBASE500	- The base Atom functionality.  You must install
	           	  this subset.

After you install the Atom kit, you may delete the temporary directory
where you unpacked the kit:

	% rm -rf <temp directory>

There is no need to reboot the system after installing this subset.

You may also wish to run the installation verification programs.
However, make sure you have a fair amount of /tmp space.  If not, set
the TMPDIR environment variable to point to a larger partition (for
example, /usr/tmp).

        % su
        # setld -v ATMBASE500

The verification program passes if it prints the following line:

        Confidence test suite passed.


Uninstalling from Tru64 UNIX V5.0
-----------------------------------

Should you want to remove the ATM500 kit from a Tru64 UNIX system
and revert to the original version of Atom, you can follow this
procedure:

	% su
	# setld -d ATMBASE500

Reporting Bugs
==============

If you find a bug in Atom, please send a description of your problem to 
atombugs@zk3.dec.com.

Please include the following information in any bug report:

	* The version of Atom, which is obtained with this command:

		% atom -version

	* The version of the operating system, which is obtained with
	  this command:

		% uname -a

	* A list of those Atom subsets that are installed, which is
	  obtained with this command:

		% /usr/sbin/setld -i | grep '^ATM'

	* A description of the problem including the exact command line
	  you passed to Atom.

	* If the problem is with a tool you wrote, either include the
	  sources for the tool's instrumentation and analysis code or
	  provide a pointer to the sources.  If you are using one of the
	  prepackaged tools in the Atom kit, you need not provide this
	  information.

	* I normally need the binary image of the application to which
	  you applied Atom.  If possible, save a copy and provide a
	  pointer to the application.
