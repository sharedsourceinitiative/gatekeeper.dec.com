Recent versions of Rdb/VMS have shown dramatic performance increases compared
with earlier versions.  Performance enhancements have culminated in an 80%
improvement between Rdb/VMS V3.0 and Rdb/VMS V4.1 when executing on the same
hardware.  This has vaulted Rdb/VMS to an industry leadership position in
$/TPS and to a very competitive position in peak TPS.  While code paths have
been shortened, the primary means of achieving this performance gain has been
through reducing I/O accesses and distributed locks.  This paper
outlines how this was done.
