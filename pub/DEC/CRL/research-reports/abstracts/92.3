	  The Organization Engine: Virtual Data Integration
	    James S. Miller, Carl Niedner, and Jack London
			    20 April 1992

The Organization Engine is an early example of Virtual Data
Integration --- providing the appearance of integration at the desktop
without modifying existing infrastructure.  Starting with the
Organization Engine, eight programming days were needed to provide
uniform desktop access to a CODASYL-compliant hospital information
system and to a MUMPS-based radiology information system (the
technique is equally effective for relational and other data bases).
The resulting tool provides a seamless integration of these two
systems, image storage, pre-recorded audio, and document storage.  In
addition to providing uniform access, the tool also allows healthcare
providers to organize the data to suit their individual needs.

The key to this easy integration lies in two simple techniques: the
transformation of data from all sources into a single, homogeneous
representation; and the use of simple customization files to describe
new object types and formats.  The approach is sufficiently general to
allow the integration of applications which present external
interfaces of radically different forms.  Two such forms are discussed
here: data map publication and transactions.
