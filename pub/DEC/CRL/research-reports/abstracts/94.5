  The hB-Pi-tree: A Concurrent and Recoverable Multi-attribute Access Method

				August 3, 1994

We describe a new access method, the hB-Pi-tree, an adaptation of the Lomet
and Salzberg hB-tree index to the constraints of their Pi-tree. The Pi-trees,
a generalization of the B-link trees of Lehman and Yao, provide very high
concurrency with recovery, hence permitting highly parallel access to data.
The hB-tree is a multi-attribute index which is highly insensitive to
dimensionality. The combination makes the hB-Pi-tree suitable for inclusion in
a general purpose database management system supporting multi-attribute and
spatial queries.
