				   ABSTRACT

Many scientific and engineering applications use models extracted from and
validated by empirical and simulation data.  Data extraction, validation, and
simulation are rarely performed by an individual, but rather by a group of
collaborators. Often these collaborators do not reside at the same location,
making collaboration and consultation difficult and costly. Unfortunately,
current scientific visualization and data exploration environments do not yet
provide telecollaborative facilities.

We describe a Telecollaborative Data Exploration system (TDE) which combines
sophisticated scientific data exploration tools with telecollaborative
capabilities.  All exploration tools available to one user are also available
to two or more users working on the same problem at other sites. TDE runs in a
heterogeneous distributed computing environment, supporting a wide variety of
displays around a centralized compute server. It offers the users customizable
views of the data.  Pointing and cursor linking are based in $n$-dimensional
object-space, rather than screen space. Finally, TDE is implemented on top of
an existing visualization system; hence, users can perform data exploration
tasks and share the results with colleagues in one single environment.
