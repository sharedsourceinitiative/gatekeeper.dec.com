This paper discusses the Gaggle, a  mechanism  for grouping and
naming  objects in a distributed system.  Using Gaggles, client
objects can access distributed replicated services without regard
for the number of objects that provide the service.  In this way
they encapsulate plurality.  Rather than imposing a particular
design philosophy, Gaggles allow implementors of replicated 
distributed services full freedom to structure those services as
they see fit.

A Gaggle behaves very much like an object: it can be named in the
same way as an object, and can be used as the invokee of an 
invocation.  However, Gaggles can be used to represent individual 
objects,  several  ordinary objects, or even several other Gaggles,
so they serve to encapsulate plurality.  If a Gaggle is  used  as
an invokee, _one_ of the objects that it represents is chosen to be
the receiver.
