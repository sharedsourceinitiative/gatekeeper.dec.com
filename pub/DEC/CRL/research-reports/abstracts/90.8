The X Window System has become widely accepted by many manufacturers.
X provides network transparent access to display servers, allowing
local and remote client programs to access a user's display.  X is
used on high performance workstation displays as well as terminals,
and client programs run on everything from micro to super computers.

This paper describes the tradeoffs and basic design decisions made
during the design of X Version 11. We presume familiarity with the
paper describing X Version 10.
