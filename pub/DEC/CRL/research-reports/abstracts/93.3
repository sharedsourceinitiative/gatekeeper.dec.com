The simultaneous recovery of 3D shape and motion from image sequences is
one of the more difficult problems in computer vision.  Classical
approaches to the problem rely on using algebraic techniques to solve for
these unknowns given two or more images.  More recently, a batch analysis
of image streams (the temporal tracks of distinguishable image features)
under orthography has resulted in highly accurate reconstructions.  We
generalize this approach to perspective projection and partial or uncertain
tracks by using a non-linear least squares technique.  While our approach
requires iteration, it quickly converges to the desired solution, even in
the absence of a priori knowledge about the shape or motion.  Important
features of the algorithm include its ability to handle partial point
tracks, to use line segment matches and point matches simultaneously, and
to use an object-centered representation for faster and more accurate
structure and motion recovery.  We also show how a projective (as opposed
to scaled rigid) structure can be recovered when the camera calibration
parameters are unknown.
