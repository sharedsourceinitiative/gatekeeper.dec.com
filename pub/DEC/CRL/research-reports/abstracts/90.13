This paper examines the construction of a 3-D surface model of an object
rotating in front of a camera.  Previous research in depth from motion has
demonstrated the power of using an incremental approach to depth
estimation.  In this paper, we extend this approach to more general motion
and use a full 3-D surface model instead of a $2\andahalf$-D sketch.  % We
also estimate the intensity distribution over the surface, which % improves
the convergence of the algorithm.  The algorithm starts with a flow field
computed using local correlation.  It then projects individual measurements
into 3-D points with associated uncertainties.  Nearby points from
successive frames are merged to improve the position estimates.  These
points are then used to construct a finite element surface model, which is
itself refined over time.  We demonstrate the application of our new
techniques to several real image sequences.

Keywords: computer vision, 3-D model construction, image sequence (motion)
