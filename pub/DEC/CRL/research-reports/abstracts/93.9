LoFi is a single-slot TURBOchannel module designed as a research
prototype to interface to a variety of audio sources and sinks. LoFi
contains two 8 KHz CODECs, a digital signal processor with 32K words of
static memory, a 44.1 KHz stereo digital-to-analog converter, and analog
and digital telephone line interfaces. This report is the technical
reference for the LoFi module and includes descriptions of the hardware
design and programming interface.  A source code kit containing LoFi
support software is available by anonymous FTP.
