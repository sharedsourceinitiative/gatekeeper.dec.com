	     Real-Time Octree Generation from Rotating Objects

The construction of a three-dimensional object model from a set of images
taken from different viewpoints is an important problem in computer vision.
One of the simplest ways to do this is to use the silhouettes of the object
(the binary classification of images into object and background) to can
construct a bounding volume for the object.  To efficiently represent this
volume, we use an octree, which represents the object as a tree of
recursively subdivided cubes.  We develop a new algorithm for computing the
octree bounding volume from multiple silhouettes, and apply it to an object
rotating on a turntable in front of a stationary camera.  The algorithm
performs a limited amount of processing for each viewpoint, and
incrementally builds the volumetric model.  The resulting algorithm
requires less total computation than previous algorithms, runs in
real-time, and builds a model whose resolution improves over time.

Keywords: computer vision, 3-D model construction, image sequence (motion)
analysis, volumetric models, octrees, silhouettes, computer aided design,
computer graphics animation.
