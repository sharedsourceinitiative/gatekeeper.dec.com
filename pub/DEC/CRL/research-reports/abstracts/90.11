Many fundamental multi-processor coordination problems can be expressed as {\em
counting problems:} processes must cooperate to assign successive values from a
given range, such as addresses in memory or destinations on an interconnection
network.  Conventional solutions to these problems perform poorly because of
synchronization bottlenecks and high memory contention.

Motivated by observations on the behavior of sorting networks, we offer a
completely new approach to solving such problems.  We introduce a new class of
networks called {\em counting networks}, i.e., networks that can be used to
count.  We give a counting network construction of depth $\log^2 n$ using $n
\log^2 n$ ``gates,'' avoiding the sequential bottlenecks inherent to former
solutions, and having a provably lower contention factor on its gates.

Finally, to show that counting networks are not merely mathematical creatures,
we provide experimental evidence that they outperform conventional
synchronization techniques under a variety of circumstances.
