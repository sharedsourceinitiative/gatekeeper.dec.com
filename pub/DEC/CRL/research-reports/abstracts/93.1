Two phase commit (2PC) is used for coordinating the commitment
of transactions in distributed systems.  The preferred 2PC optimization
is the presumed abort variant, which reduces the number of messages when
transactions are aborted, and eliminates the coordinator's need to retain
information about aborted transactions.  The presumed commit 2PC variant
provides a larger message reduction, but its coordinator must do additional
logging.  We describe a new form of presumed commit that reduces the number of
log writes while preserving the reduction in messages, bringing both these
costs below those of presumed abort.  The penalty for this is the need to
retain a small amount of crash related information forever.
