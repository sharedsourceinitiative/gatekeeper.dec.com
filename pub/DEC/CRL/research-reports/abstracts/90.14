Neuroscientists have studied the relationship between nerve cell morphology 
and function for over a century. To pursue these studies, they need accurate 
three-dimensional models of nerve cells that facilitate detailed anatomical 
measurement and the identification of internal structures. Although serial 
transmission electron microscopy has been a source of such models since the 
mid 1960s, model reconstruction and analysis remain very time consuming.
We have developed a new approach to reconstructing and visualizing 3D nerve 
cell models from serial microscopy.  An interactive system exploits recent 
computer graphics and computer vision techniques to significantly reduce the 
time required to build such models. The key ingredients of the system are a 
digital ``blink comparator'' for section registration, ``snakes,'' or active 
deformable contours, for semi-automated cell segmentation, and voxel-based 
techniques for 3D reconstruction and visualization of complex cell volumes 
with internal structures.


Keywords: scientific visualization, 3D reconstruction, image registration,
