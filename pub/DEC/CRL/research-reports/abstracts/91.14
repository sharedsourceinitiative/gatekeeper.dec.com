Splines and deformable surface models are widely used in computer graphics
to describe free-form surfaces.  These methods require manual preprocessing
to discretize the surface into patches and to specify their connectivity.
We present a new model of elastic surfaces based on interacting particle
systems, which, unlike previous techniques, can be used to split, join, or
extend surfaces without the need for manual intervention.  The particles we
use have long-range attraction forces and short-range repulsion forces and
follow Newtonian dynamics, much like recent computational models of fluids
and solids.  To enable our particles to model surface elements instead of
point masses or volume elements, we add an orientation to each particle's
state.  We devise new interaction potentials for our {\em oriented
particles} which favor locally planar or spherical arrangements.  We also
develop techniques for adding new particles automatically, which enables
our surfaces to stretch and grow.  We demonstrate the application of our
new particle system to modeling surfaces in 3-D and the interpolation of
3-D point sets.

Keywords: computer graphics, geometric modeling, surface interpolation,
particle systems, physically-based modeling, oriented particles, dynamics,
simulation.
