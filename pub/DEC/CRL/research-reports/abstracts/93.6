To help solve heterogeneity and distributed computing problems, vendors 
are offering distributed system services that have standard programming 
interfaces and protocols. Standard programming interfaces make it easier
to port applications to a variety of platforms, giving the customer some
vendor-independence.  Standard protocols enable programs to interoperate.
These distributed system services are called middleware, because they sit 
``in the middle,'' layering above the operating system and networking 
software and below industry-specific applications. This paper classifies
different kinds of middleware, describes their properties, and explains 
their evolution. The goal is to provide a common vocabulary and conceptual
model for understanding today's and tomorrow's distributed system software.


Keywords and Phrases: distributed system, framework, information utility,
interoperability, middleware, portability, system engineering, transaction
processing monitor.
