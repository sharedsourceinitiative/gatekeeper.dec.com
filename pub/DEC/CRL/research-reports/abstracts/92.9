For a data sharing database system, substantial coordination cost is incurred
to cope with the global (distributed) locking needed by these systems.  Lock 
covering is a way to permit component systems to perform private (local) 
locking.  Two forms of covering locks are discussed, together with intention  
locks, needed to prevent covering violations.  Intention locks give permission 
for lower level locking to be used, but require that this locking be global.
The protocol between local lock manager and its principals is defined to
permit information needed for local locking to be conveyed.  Principals are 
notified when lock demotion may change local locks to global ones.  New lock 
modes are defined that provide exclusion without being covering locks.  These 
locks facilitate database cache management and private logical locking, 
permitting exclusion with high concurrency, and providing improved concurrency 
vs overhead trade-offs.
