	       Image Mosaicing for Tele-Reality Applications

While a large number of virtual reality applications, such as fluid flow
analysis and molecular modeling, deal with simulated data, many newer
applications attempt to recreate true reality as convincingly as possible.
Building detailed models for such applications, which we call tele-reality,
is a major bottleneck holding back their deployment.  In this paper, we
present techniques for automatically deriving realistic 2-D scenes and 3-D
texture-mapped models from video sequences, which can help overcome this
bottleneck.  The fundamental technique we use is image mosaicing, i.e., the
automatic alignment of multiple images into larger aggregates which are
then used to represent portions of a 3-D scene.  We begin with the easiest
problems, those of flat scene and panoramic scene mosaicing, and progress
to more complicated scenes, culminating in full 3-D models.  We also
present a number of novel applications based on tele-reality technology.
