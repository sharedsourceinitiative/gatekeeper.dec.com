	      Acquiring Knowledge for Validation Models
		 Evangelos Simoudis and James Miller
			    November 1990

We present a methodology for building validation models, the knowledge
structure used during the retrieval phase of our case-based reasoning
systems.  This methodology allows a knowledge engineer to start with a
textual database of previously solved cases and quickly produce an
effective case-based reasoning system.  Using our methodology, we have
built two such systems; one of these systems operates on a domain
spanning 60% of the problems presented to an existing rule-based
expert system.  By comparison, the rule-based system took four times
as long to construct at an estimated cost six times as great.  While
our system successfully solves 100% of the problems in its domain, the
rule-based system is only capable of solving 40% of the problems in
the full domain.
