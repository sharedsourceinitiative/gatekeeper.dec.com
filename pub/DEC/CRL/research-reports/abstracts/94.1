The problem of image registration subsumes a number of problems and
techniques in multiframe image analysis, including the computation of optic
flow (general pixel-based motion), stereo correspondence, structure from
motion, and feature tracking.  We present a new registration algorithm
based on spline representations of the displacement field which can be
specialized to solve all of the above mentioned problems.  In particular,
we show how to compute local flow, global (parametric) flow, rigid flow
resulting from camera egomotion, and multiframe versions of the above
problems.  Using a spline-based description of the flow removes the need
for overlapping correlation windows, and produces an explicit measure of
the correlation between adjacent flow estimates.  We demonstrate our
algorithm on multiframe image registration and the recovery of 3D
projective scene geometry.  We also provide results on a number of standard
motion sequences.
