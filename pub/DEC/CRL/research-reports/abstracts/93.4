This report addresses the problem of automatically synchronizing computer
generated faces with synthetic speech.  The complete process is called 
DECface which provides a novel form of face-to-face communication and 
the ability to create a new range of talking it personable synthetic
characters.  Based on plain ASCII text input, a synthetic speech segment
is generated and synchronized in real-time to a graphical display of an
articulating mouth and face.  The key component of DECface is the run-time
facility that adaptively synchronizes the graphical display of the face
to the audio.
