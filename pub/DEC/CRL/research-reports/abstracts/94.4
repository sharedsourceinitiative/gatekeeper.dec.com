				   ABSTRACT

Writing efficient code for parallel processors is still a rather complex and
little understood task.  Tools to gather and analyze performance information
during program execution are essential for understanding the reasons for
inefficient executions.  Current performance visualization systems provide
only a limited set of capabilities, hardwired into huge, monolithic programs.
Programmers need a very flexible environment in which they can mix and match
different performance visualization tools.

Research in scientific visualization has developed several environments to
visualize, explore and analyze large quantities of data.  Reusing these
capabilities to visualize MIMD performance data significantly helps in the
development of a performance profiler.  However, scientific visualization
methods have to be altered appropriately to address the non-geometric nature
of performance data.

This paper presents a profiler, PerfVisS, which builds upon existing
Telecollaborative Data Exploration (TDE) technology.  PerfVisS provides
several linked views of the performance data, both for gaining a general
overview of the program performance and for detailed data and code inspection.
It also allows users to adapt the system to their own viewing preferences,
using the AVS visual programming interface.  Furthermore, it provides tools
for telecollaborative performance tuning, allowing programmers to share their
views with colleagues at remote sites.  PerfVisS runs on Alpha AXP workstation
farms but could be used as well on other similar MIMD architectures such as
symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs).
