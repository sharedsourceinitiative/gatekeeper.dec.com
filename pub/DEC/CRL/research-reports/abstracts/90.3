   Consistent Timestamping for Transactions in Distributed Systems

Tagging data in a database with timestamps that indicate when data was
entered can be very useful.  It permits a user to query the database
as of some historical time.  Further, it permits a user to see a
transaction consistent "recent" version of the database without having
this transaction interfere with ongoing updates.  This support
requires that timestamp ordering represent a valid serialization of
the transactions.  Achieving this in a distributed system is
potentially troublesome.  This paper suggests that the two phase
commit protocol messages can be used to establish and distribute a
correct timestamp to all transaction cohorts.  Refinements permit this
concept to deal with heterogenous systems where not all cohorts
perform timestamping.  Early release of read locks can be supported
via bounding the range in which a transaction is permitted to commit.
