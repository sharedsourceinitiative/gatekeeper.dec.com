Recovering the shape of an object from two views fails at occluding
contours of smooth objects because the extremal contours are view
dependent.  For three or more views, shape recovery is possible, and
several algorithms have recently been developed for this purpose.  We
present a new approach to the multiframe stereo problem which does not
depend on differential measurements in the image, which may be noise
sensitive.  Instead, we use a linear smoother to optimally combine all of
the measurements available at the contours (and other edges) in all of the
images.  This allows us to extract a robust and dense estimate of surface
shape, and to integrate shape information from both surface markings and
occluding contours.
