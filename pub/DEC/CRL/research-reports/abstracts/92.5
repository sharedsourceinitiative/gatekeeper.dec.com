A snapshot scan algorithm takes an ``instantaneous'' picture of a region of
shared memory that may be updated by concurrent processes.  Many complex and
difficult shared memory algorithms can be greatly simplified by structuring
them around the snapshot scan abstraction.  Unfortunately, the substantial
decrease in conceptual complexity is sometimes counterbalanced by an increase
in computational complexity.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of a weak snapshot scan, a slightly
weaker primitive that has a more efficient implementation.  We propose the
following methodology for using this abstraction: First, design and verify an
algorithm using the more powerful snapshot scan, and second, replace the more
powerful but less efficient snapshot with the weaker but more efficient
snapshot, and show that the weaker abstraction nevertheless suffices to ensure
the correctness of the enclosing algorithm.  We give two examples of algorithms
whose performance can be enhanced while retaining a simple modular structure:
randomized consensus and bounded concurrent timestamping.  The resulting
randomized consensus protocol is the fastest known protocol that uses only
bounded values, and the timestamping protocol is as fast as the best known
timestamping protocol, but conceptually simpler.
