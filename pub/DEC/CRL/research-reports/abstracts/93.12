Most complexity measures for concurrent algorithms for asynchronous 
shared-memory architectures focus on process steps and memory consumption.
In practice, however, performance of multiprocessor algorithms is heavily 
influenced by contention, the extent to which processes access the same 
location at the same time.  Nevertheless, even though contention is 
one of the principal considerations affecting the performance of real 
algorithms on real multiprocessors, there are no formal tools for 
analyzing the contention of asynchronous shared-memory algorithms.
 
This paper introduces the first formal complexity model for contention
in multiprocessors.  We focus on the standard multiprocessor architecture
in which n asynchronous processes communicate by applying read, write,
and read-modify-write operations to a shared memory.  We use our model
to derive two kinds of results: (1) lower bounds on contention for well
known basic problems such as agreement and mutual exclusion, and (2)
trade-offs between latency (maximal number of accesses to shared variables
performed by a single process in executing the algorithm) and contention
for these algorithms. Furthermore, we give the first formal performance
analysis of counting networks, a class of concurrent data structures
implementing shared counters. Experiments indicate that certain counting
networks outperform conventional single-variable counters at high levels
of contention.  Our analysis provides the first formal explanation for
this phenomenon.
