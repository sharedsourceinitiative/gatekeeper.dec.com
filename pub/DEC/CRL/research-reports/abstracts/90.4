      Recovery for Shared Disk Systems Using Multiple Redo Logs
			    David B. Lomet
			     October 1990

A new method for redo logging and recovery is described.  It is
designed to work in a data sharing system where multiple nodes can
access common data.  Particularly important is that each node can have
its own log.  Crash recovery is possible based on the contents of just
one of these logs.  Media recovery is supported via a form of merging
of the logs.  The method requires no time synchronization between
nodes, and does not use timestamps to order the log records during the
merge.  The method should work with many undo recovery methods.
Conventional checkpointing schemes can be adapted to the scheme,
enabling the redo scan point to be advanced and the log to be
truncated.  Finally, the method makes possible a new paradigm for
distributed DBMSs which has the potential to exploit inexpensive
desktop processing and improve availability and responsiveness.
