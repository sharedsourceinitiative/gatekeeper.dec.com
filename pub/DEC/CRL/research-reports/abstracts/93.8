AudioFile is a portable, device-independent, network-transparent system 
for computer audio systems.  Similar to the X Window System, it provides 
an abstract interface with a simple network protocol to support a variety
of audio hardware and multiple simultaneous clients.  This report describes
our approach to digital audio, the AudioFile protocol, the client library,
the audio server, and some client applications.  It also discusses the 
performance of the system and our experience with using standard network 
protocols for audio.  A source code distribution is available for anonymous
FTP.
