Many fundamental multi-processor coordination problems can be expressed
as counting problems: processes must cooperate to assign successive
values from a given range, such as addresses in memory or destinations
on an interconnection network.  Conventional solutions to these problems
perform poorly because of synchronization bottlenecks and high memory
contention.

Motivated by observations on the behavior of sorting networks, we offer
a new approach to solving such problems, by introducing counting networks,
a new class of networks that can be used to count.  We give two counting
network constructions, one of depth log n (1+ log n) / 2 using n log n 
(1+ log n) / 4 ``gates,'' and a second of depth log^2 n using nlog^2 n / 
2 gates.  These networks avoid the sequential bottlenecks inherent to 
earlier solutions, and substantially lower the memory contention.

Finally, to show that counting networks are not merely mathematical 
creatures, we provide experimental evidence that they outperform 
conventional synchronization techniques under a variety of circumstances.
