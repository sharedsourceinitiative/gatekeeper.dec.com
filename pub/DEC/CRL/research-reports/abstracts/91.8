Providing high concurrency in B+trees has been studied 
extensively.  But few efforts have been documented for combining 
concurrency methods with a recovery scheme that preserves well-formed trees
across system crashes.  We describe an approach for this that works for a
class of index trees that is a generalization of the B-link tree.  
A major feature of our method is that it works with a range of 
different recovery methods.  It achieves this by decomposing structure
changes in an index tree into a sequence of atomic actions, each one leaving
the tree well-formed and each working on a separate level of the tree.  All
atomic actions on levels of the tree above the leaf level are independent of
database transactions, and so are of short duration.
