This paper presents a feature tracker for long image sequences based on
simultaneously estimating the motions and deformations of a collection of
adjacent image patches.  By sharing common corner nodes, the patches
achieve greater stability than independent patch trackers.  Modeling full
bilinear deformations enables tracking in sequences which have large
non-translational motions and/or foreshortening effects.  We demonstrate
the advantages of our technique with respect to previous algorithms
using experimental results.
