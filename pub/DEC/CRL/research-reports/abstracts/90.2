	     Validated Retrieval in Case-Based Reasoning
		 Evangelos Simoudis and James Miller
			    September 1990

We combine simple retrieval with domain-specific validation of
retrieved cases to produce a useful practical tool for case-based
reasoning.  Based on 200 real-world cases, we retrieve between three
and six cases over a wide range of new problems.  This represents a
selectivity ranging from 1.5% to 3%, compared to an average
selectivity of only 11% from simple retrieval alone.
