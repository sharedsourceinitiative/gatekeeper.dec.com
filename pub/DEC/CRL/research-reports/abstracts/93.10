Organizations often impose an administrative security policy when they
connect to other organizations on a public network such as the
Internet.  Many applications have their own notions of security, or
they simply rely on the security of the underlying protocols.  Using
the X Window System as a case study, we describe some techniques for
building application-specific ``relays'' that allow the use of
applications across organizational boundaries.  In particular, we
focus on analyzing administrative and application-specific security
policies to construct solutions that satisfy the security requirements
while providing the necessary functions of the applications.

This is a preprint of a paper to appear in the Proceedings of the USENIX
Summer Conference, June, 1993.
