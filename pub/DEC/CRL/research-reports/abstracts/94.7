Typically, users of teleconferencing desktop applications must use 
headphones to eliminate the direct-path echo introduced by having a 
loudspeaker and a microphone in the same room. Unfortunately, many 
users prefer not to use headphones. Implementing echo cancelation 
would be one way for desktop audio conferencing systems to overcome 
this limitation.

One technique used to remove the echo is to introduce an autoregressive 
filter to identify the echo path impulse response defined by the system 
Speaker + Room + Microphone. The signal output to the speaker is then 
filtered by the estimated echo path impulse response, and the result is 
subtracted from the degraded input speech to obtain an estimate of the 
input speech without echoes.

In this paper, we describe the identification process which leads to the 
least mean square (LMS) algorithms and the recursive least square (RLS) 
algorithms. We also present an ``Echo-Cancelation Software Lab'' which 
was implemented and optimized to allow real-time testing of the LMS, 
normalized  LMS, homogeneous adaptation, and individual adaptation 
algorithms.
