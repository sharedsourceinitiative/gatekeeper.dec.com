     Today's fastest general purpose microprocessors have performance
     equaling or exceeding that of the fastest available DSP chips.
     This paper argues that signal processing applications will migrate
     from specialized DSP coprocessors into the host processor of
     high performance personal computers and workstations.  DSP chips
     will have a place in synchronous, low latency data handling, but
     increasingly, the computation of signal processing algorithms will
     be handled by general purpose processors.
