Order preserving data compression can improve sorting and searching
performance, and hence the performance of database systems.  We describe a new
parsing (tokenization) technique that can be effectively applied to ``keys",
producing substantial compression.  It can be applied to both the uncompressed
and compressed strings, permiting a more flexible choice of variable length
dictionary entries and their compressed forms.  The key notion is that the way
that entries partition the space of strings determines how the entries are to
be parsed.  The result is economy in the number of encodings that are needed
in order to preserve order and great flexibility in how they are encoded.  We
illustrate one use of order preserving compression, padding character
compression for multifield keys.  This demonstrates the dramatic gains
possible with the new technique, some of which cannot be achieved by any other
method.
