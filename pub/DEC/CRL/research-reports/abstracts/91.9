Modern database systems provide media recovery by taking periodic backups and
applying a transaction log to the backup to bring the data up-to-date.
A multi-versioned database is one that retains and provides access to historical
versions of data.  This paper shows how a history database, supported by
the Time-Split B-tree, can be used to also provide the backup function of
media recovery.  Thus, the same versions used for database history are used
for database backup.  The cost of taking a backup is  comparable to the cost
of a good differential backup method, where only changed data is backed up.
The  media recovery cost, especially when the media failure is only partial,
e.g. a single disk page, will usually be lower.
