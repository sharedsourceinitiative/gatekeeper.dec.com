Rollback databases are multiversion databases that use transaction time to
identify the versions of the data.  Such databases support queries that request
information "as-of" some specific past time.  This report describes most of
the technical aspects of supporting rollback databases.  It shows
how to to do the timestamping itself, including how to cope with distributed
systems.  Using the TSB-tree, we show how multi-version data can be
efficiently  indexed, efficient both in space and in query time.  How one
provides high concurrency while updating a TSB-tree is described next. 
Finally, we show how one can use a rollback database as a backup source to
provide media failure recovery.

Keywords: rollback databases, multiversions, timestamping, concurrency,
