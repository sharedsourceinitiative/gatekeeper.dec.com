"Phantoms" are records inserted into a concurrently selected set of 
records specified by a predicate such that the selection does not see 
a transaction consistent result.  The usual locking strategy is to lock
only existing records.  However, records that satisfy the selection 
predicate must be locked even when they are not present in the database
to prevent their insertion.  One way to cope with phantoms is through 
range locking, a limited form of predicate locking.  We investigate 
lock modes for ranges and describe new lock modes that greatly increase
concurrency.  We explore locking strategies involving range, key, and 
record resources that permit trade-offs between concurrency and lock 
overhead.
