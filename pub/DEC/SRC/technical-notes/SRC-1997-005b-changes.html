<H2>Changes included in SRC Technical Note 1997-005b</H2>

<P>The following list reflects the complete set of changes made to SRC

<LI>The keyword <CODE>include</CODE> is changed to
<CODE>import</CODE>.  The old keyword had a misleading connotation of
textual macro inclusion.

<P><LI> The syntax of list constructors is changed to use angle
brackets instead of square brackets.  This syntax creates a minor
ambiguity in the grammar; a new section explains how the ambiguity is
resolved.

<P><LI> The types t_nil, t_binding_ne, and t_list_ne are eliminated.
Empty list and empty binding are now distinct values of type t_list
and t_binding.  This change was made possible by the change to list
syntax, which creates a syntactic distinction between empty list and
empty binding that was previously lacking.

<P><LI> The syntactic sugar [ = Id ] for the binding constructor [ Id
= Id ] is removed.  New syntactic sugar [ Id ] for [ Id = Id ]
replaces it.  This change makes the binding syntax used in the body of
a model more consistent with that used in the files and import
clauses.  It was made possible by the change to list syntax; formerly
[ Id ] denoted a list.

<P><LI> The desugaring of [ GenArc Delim = Id ] to [ GenArc = [ Id =
Id ] ] is removed.  A new desugaring of [ GenArc Delim = Expr ] to [
GenArc = Expr ] replaces it.  This change removes an apparently
useless feature and gives meaning to certain expressions that were
formerly syntactically legal but semantically undefined.

<P><LI> The definition of the identifier token is more liberal; an
identifier token may now begin with a digit, as long as it does not
match the pattern for an integer token.  This change removes the need
for extra quotation marks in certain common cases, such as when a
model is being imported from a branch.

<P><LI> Octal constants are now permitted.

<P><LI> The description of tokenization is more precise.

<P><LI> The meaning of an Arc nonterminal that matches an Integer
token is clarified.

<P><LI> The Files and Imports clauses now accept a general Arc on the
left-hand side of an equal sign, but a new semantic rule forbids
defining a top-level name that is not a legal identifier.  This clears
up some poorly defined cases and disagreements between the spec and
the implementation.

<P><LI> Special cases in the translation of DelimPaths to filenames
are corrected and clarified.

<P><LI> The _par_map primitive is added.

<P><LI> The type syntax is changed to use parentheses uniformly
instead of using square brackets for lists and bindings.

<P><LI> Some minor typos and wording errors are corrected.
