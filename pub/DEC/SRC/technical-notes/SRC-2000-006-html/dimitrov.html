    <TD><B>1 Introduction</B> 
      <P>Juno-2 is an extensible constraint-based drawing editor created by Greg 
      Nelson and Allan Heydon [1], which was originally designed for producing 
      high-quality still illustrations. Juno-2 permits arbitrary constraints to 
      be specified using a declarative notation based on the theory of real 
      numbers with a pairing function and equality. After the constraints have 
      been specified, any degrees of freedom that remain in the drawing may be 
      adjusted interactively with the mouse. Thus, Juno-2 makes it easy to 
      illustrate and to explore virtually any geometric construction in the 
      Euclidean plane. 
      <P>Long before my internship, Allan and Greg had written in the Juno 
      language [2] a module for playing animations [3]. Greg had animated a 
      fragment of Archimedes's reasoning for the area of the circle. Most SRCers 
      who had seen Greg's animation thought that it communicated superbly the 
      crux of Archimedes's proof. My job this summer was to extend Juno-2 with 
      features that would make it easier to produce such animations. 
      <P><B>2 DimiTeX</B> 
      <P>One difficulty that Greg had encountered in animating Archimedes proof 
      was that typesetting mathematical formulas with Juno-2 was a very tedious 
      task. In order for Juno to display <i>&#960;r<SUP>2</SUP></I>, Greg had to type a 30 line 
      program that switched the current font to "Symbol" and back again as the 
      letter <i>&#960;</i> was displayed, and then raised the superscript "2" up by 
      one-third of the current font's height. 
      <P>Because Greek letters, mathematical symbols, superscripts and 

      subscripts occur commonly in proofs, I implemented a subset of TeX's 
      functionality in Juno. My implementation, which Greg named DimiTeX, mostly 
      adheres to TeX's syntax; however, DimiTeX's escape character is the 
      exclamation mark '!', because the backslash '\' was already taken by Juno. 
      For example, here is what we would have to type in Juno-xyt for the 
      formula <i>&#960;r<SUP>2</SUP></I> to appear at position <i>a</i>. 
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DimiTeX.Show(a, "$!pi r^2$") 
      <P>Greg wrote the documentation for DimiTeX's syntax which is included in 
      the Juno-xyt manual page. 
      <P>Some proofs use symbols that are not available in the bundled 

      PostScript and X fonts. With Juno, it is easy to draw a new symbol and to 
      encapsulate the resulting closure as a DimiTeX glyph. This glyph can be 
      bound to a DimiTeX control sequence, such as "!mynewsym". (Even animated 
      drawings can be encapsulated as DimiTeX glyphs. That's how we created the 
      DimiTeX "!circle{...}" macro, which slowly draws a circle around any 
      formula.) 
      <P>While dragging a compound formula across the screen, I observed a 
      curious effect which Greg called "rounding flicker". Consider the distance 
      between a superscript and a subscript in the same <BR>formula. The real 
      number with which DimiTeX represents this distance may not be divisible by 
      the screen's pixel size, but the physical distance on the screen always 
      is. The window system rounds DimiTeX's real number either up or down, 
      depending on the formula's current position. As the formula is being 
      dragged, its current position changes, and so does the physical distance 
      between the superscript and the subscript on the screen.&nbsp; We did not 
      fix the resulting flicker, because we had other fun things to do. 

      <P><B>3 Animation</B> 
      <P>An animation can be fun even if it does not prove a theorem. Early in 
      the summer, Greg and I created an animation showing how a calligrapher 
      might write "Juno xyt". Juno-2 already had a calligraphic pen that could 
      be easily applied to the current PostScript path. Still, given a 

      PostScript path which consists of a few dozen Bezier segments, how would 
      you draw that fraction of the path which is visible in the animation's 
      current frame? 
      <P>We first solved this problem for a single Bezier segment by using De 
      Casteljau's construction. That is, we obtained Bezier control points for 
      the visible fraction of our segment by nesting a number of simultaneous 
      "sliders". (After this exercise, we created a graphical slider in the Juno 
      user interface and connected it to the Juno variable "UISlider.val"). Then 
      we encapsulated each segment of the PostScript path into a separate 
      animation closure. Finally, we defined a new composition primitive called 
      "Seq2" which right-reduced the list of single-segment animations into a 
      single closure that animated the entire path. 
      <P>Toward summer's end, we used the same "Seq2" to tie together the steps 
      of a calculational "Feijen style" proof that the Fermat numbers 

      <i>(2 exp 2<SUP>n</SUP>)+1</i> are pairwise relatively prime. Actually, only two of the 
      animated slides in that proof were "Feijen style" --- more traditional 
      "title slides" stated the results that were to be proved. We grouped the 
      various slides into "scenes" so that slide transitions within a scene were 
      made automatically by Juno, whereas "show mode" transitions from one scene 
      to the next would occur only in response to user events. We also 

      implemented a "Scene menu" in the user interface that allowed us to view 
      the scenes in random order while working in "edit mode". Edit mode is the 
      mode that Juno starts in; show mode is a mode for giving full-screen 
      presentations that we added this summer. 
      <P><B>4 Conclusion</B> 
      <P>Some of the extensions that we added this summer -- for example DimiTeX 
      -- work just as well in Juno-2 as they do in Juno-xyt. Although this is 
      also true of the last and the least trivial to implement addition that I 
      will describe --- a facility for unfolding and refolding predicates and 
      templates and for "narrowing" predicates --- we were not hard-pressed to 
      make this addition to Juno until we started producing larger animations. 
      That's because still illustrations seldom use the same predicates and the 
      same templates instantiated over and over for the exact same parameter 
      values, which would be required for automated editing operations to pay 
      off. But that's just what happens in slide shows and animations --- they 
      usually consist of many scenes all of which are derived from the same 
      template. For example, all scenes in Greg's animation of Archimedes's 
      proof display a caption at the exact same anchor point. What if, while 
      editing scene N, Greg needed to move down that anchor point in order to 
      make room for a larger caption? In Juno-2, he would have had to edit 
      manually all other scenes in addition to editing scene N (please note that 
      storing the anchor point in a global variable is not a valid option, 
      because there may be non-trivial constraints relating the anchor point to 
      other points in the same template). In Juno-xyt, Greg would get away by 
      editing just the common template --- assuming that he has read the "Using 
      Schemes" section of the Juno-xyt manual page.
