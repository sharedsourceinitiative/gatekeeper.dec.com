<td><b>1 Introduction</b>
<p>This summer, I worked with Tim Mann on building Cloudburst, a device
driver that enables persistent file storage on handheld computers with
flash memory, such as the Itsy. Cloudburst is a compressing, log-structured
logical disk. Currently, handheld computers with flash generally have read-only
file systems, or read-write file systems with no compression.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2 Flash Memory</b>
<p>Flash memory has characteristics that make it different from most other
forms of persistent storage. To its advantage, reading and writing flash
is nearly as fast as reading and writing DRAM. However, flash can not generally
be rewritten. Each bit in a flash memory has an erase state -- say, 1.
When the flash is erased, all of the bits in the flash are set to 1. Each
individual bit may be flipped to 0 at any time. But to flip back from 0
to 1, an entire sector of the flash must be erased simultaneously. Sectors
are large, often 256 KB or 512 KB, and it takes a long time to erase a
sector, nearly a second.
<p>For this reason, rewriting small blocks of data in-place on flash memory
is very inefficient. For example, suppose we are trying to store an array
of 1024 512-byte blocks in a sector of flash. Suppose we need to update
one of the blocks, and that some of the bits in the block will flip from
0 to 1 when we do the update. To do the update, we'll need to:
<ol>
<li>
Read the entire half-MB sector into memory from flash</li>

<li>
Update the block in memory</li>

<li>
Erase the sector</li>

<li>
Rewrite the entire sector from memory to flash</li>
</ol>
Besides being time- and memory-consuming, this approach also leaves a sizable
window of opportunity for data loss, should the system lose power. Furthermore,
each sector of flash may only be erased about 100,000 times. After that,
it no longer guarantees data integrity.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>3 Cloudburst Rationale</b>
<p>We designed Cloudburst to be:
<ul>
<li>
log structured, because writing blocks in-place on flash is very inefficient</li>

<li>
compressing, because flash is generally quite small, and file systems expand
to fill all available space</li>

<li>
a logical disk, because implementing complete file systems is tricky and
unnecessary. By working at a lower level, we can support many different
file systems.</li>
</ul>
The logical disk abstraction is a layer between the file system and the
storage medium. To the file system, the logical (or virtual) disk acts
like a normal, magnetic disk: it reads and writes blocks of a fixed size.
However, under the covers, the logical disk can store the data on the storage
medium however it chooses.
<p>In the case of Cloudburst, we store the data in a log, writing blocks
sequentially on the flash. Because there is no minimum write granularity
on the flash, we can compress the blocks as we write them to the log without
losing space due to fragmentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4 Related Work</b>
<p>Many different combinations of compression, log-structure, logical disks,
and flash-friendliness have been tried before. To the best of our knowledge,
the combination of all four has never been tried.

<p><b>5 Acknowledgments</b>
<p>I would like to thank Tim Mann, my host, for being so helpful, available,
and knowledgeable about the task at hand. Thanks also to Mike Burrows for
explaining various compression algorithms and coming up with so many great
ideas for Cloudburst's cleaner algorithms.
