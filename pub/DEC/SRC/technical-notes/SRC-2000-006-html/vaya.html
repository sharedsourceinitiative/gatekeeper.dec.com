    <TD><BR><B><FONT size=+1>1 Introduction</FONT></B> 
      <P>I am between the first and second year of&nbsp; my Masters leading to a 
      PhD program at UCLA. The area of my research interest is Cryptography. 
      <P>An interesting part of my Summer Internship at SRC was that my host 
      gave me the flexibility to define a project/problem for myself to work on. 
      This gave me a lot of time to talk to the researchers at SRC for the first 
      few weeks. I spent the 2-3 weeks studying the problem of designing an 
      Uncensorable Bulletin Board with Mark Lillibridge and prototyping a spam 
      resistant mailing system with Mark Manasse (my host). However, we didn't 
      implement either of these ideas. 
      <P>I had the opportunity to work on two independent problems during the 
      rest of the summer which I summarize in the next two sections. <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><B><FONT size=+1>2 On Existence of Incompressible functions</FONT></B> 
      <P>Dwork, Lotspeich, Naor ([2]) proposed a scheme for protecting Digital 
      content from illegal distribution using a novel concept of "Digital 
      Signets: Self Enforcing Protection of Digital Information". The main idea 
      of the scheme was to make the decryption key to some encrypted digital 
      information as large as the actual data, itself. A user is given a signet 
      which is associated with his credit card number and using the pair the 
      user can compute a decryption key to the encrypted digital data available 
      publicly. Thus, a cheating user has two options: either part with his 
      credit card number, or transmit a decryption key as large as the data 
      itself! This claim, however, is not proved. 
      <P>Dwork et. al. conjectured that the security of their scheme is based on 
      the incompressiblity of the function:
      <P><CENTER><IMG height=15 src="vaya.gif" width=150></CENTER> 
      <P>An incompressible function can be defined as follows. Consider two 
      communicating parties. One party knows a short x and wants to communicate 
      to another party the long value of &#402;(<I>x</I>) without revealing <I>x</I>. 
      Roughly speaking, &#402; is incompressible if no feasible computable short 
      message from the sender to the receiver simultaneously achieves both goals 
      of enabling the receiver to compute &#402;(<I>x</I>), and hiding <I>x</I>. The 
      principal open problem suggested by [2] was to prove the 
      existence/inexistence of incompressible functions based on standard 
      cryptographic assumptions. 
      <P>Working with Cynthia, I proved that Diffie-Hellman series is 
      incompressible, under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. The main 
      idea behind the proof is that if there exists polynomial time computable 
      algorithm A for compressing the value of the series and polynomial time 
      algorithm A' for retrieving the value of the series using this compressed 
      value then there exists a polynomial time algorithm that can distinguish 
      between a Diffie-Hellman Triplet and a triplet selected uniformly from the 
      set of triplets in group Gp. The heart of the proof involved generating 
      randomized Diffie-Hellman Series (or any series) using the ideas of Naor 
      &amp; Reingold, [1] from a Diffie-Hellman triplet (or a random triplet). 
      <P>Although we made some progress it still remains an open problem to 
      prove that the Signet Scheme is secure if the Diffie-Hellman series is 
      incompressible. Another is to design an incompressible function that 
      doesn't require a large publicly known data. A working manuscript of the 
      proof may be available upon request from the authors (i.e., Cynthia &amp; 
      myself). <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><B><FONT size=+1>3 Resilient Deniable Authentication</FONT></B> 
      <P>I kept myself busy attending a workshop on Algorithmic Number Theory 
      and CRYPTO-2000 for a couple of weeks and then we sought for a new problem 
      to work on. In a joint work with Cynthia and Moni Naor (at Stanford) we 
      studied Deniable Authentication protocols under Intrusive Adversaries. The 
      motivation behind this work can be found while trying to construct a 
      protocol for "Stock Brokering Without Trust" or "Private Retrieval of 
      Medical Database". 
      <P>The resiliency of an authentication protocol is defined with respect to 
      the VIEW of an adversary. For example, an adversary having the read access 
      to the communication channel between the prover and the verifier is more 
      powerful and has a larger VIEW compared to an adversary who would just 
      believe a verifier based on the Transcript that the verifier gives to the 
      prover. We classify that an adversary could be: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>1. Online/Offline: An adversary is called Online if it 
        concurrently interacts with the verifier while he gets some message 
        <B><I>m</I></B> authenticated from the prover. If the adversary behaves 
        in an "assign &amp; collect" fashion he is called an Offline Adversary. 
        <P>2. Eavesdropping: An adversary is called eavesdropping if it has the 
        read access to the communication line between the prover and the 
        verifier. 
        <P>3. Coercing: An adversary is called Coercing if it can suggest the 
        verifier to send some message <B><I>m</I></B> or use some string of 
        random bits for composing the message etc. We proved a number of 
        possiblity/impossiblity results regarding the existence of 
        authentication protocols under various combinations of adversaries as 
        listed above. A working mansucript of the results is under preparation 
        (vis-a-vis 09/18/00).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
