<td><b>1 Introduction</b>
<p>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science
at Rice University. I am working with Willy Zwaenepoel, my advisor, on
distributed services. During my internship at SRC during summer 2000, I
worked with Mark Lillibridge, my host, and Mike Burrows on building a prototype
of a cooperative backup system.
<p><b>2 Cooperative Backup System</b>
<p>In this system, each machine stores its backup data remotely among a
group of other peer machines, and in return it stores equivalent amounts
of data from its partners in its local file system. This form of cooperation
and distribution gives several benefits and poses several interesting challenges.
Let us first consider the benefits. As the partners are independent and
geographically distributed, they have independent failure modes, which
is important for a backup system and corresponds to taking the backup tapes
off-site. In addition, this cooperation makes the system very cost effective
as the partners do not have to pay a fee to a third party for the backup
service and there is no need to purchase new equipment. As for the challenges
in the design of the system, the partners do not trust each other and it
is possible that some partners are down at any moment. Therefore, we had
to use several techniques to ensure confidentiality, robustness, integrity,
and cooperation.
<p>As the backup data might be sensitive and is stored remotely, we used
secret key cryptography to encrypt the data. In particular, we used IDEA
to encrypt the backup data before sending it to the partners during a backup
operation and to decrypt the data during a restore operation. To ensure
that the partners could not modify the data unnoticed, we used a cryptographic
hash function to make the data blocks self-checking. So, when a machine
is retrieving its data during a restore operation, it could check the cryptographic
hash values in the data blocks to make sure that it is the same data that
was backed up during the last backup operation. We used erasure codes to
add redundancy to the data, so it is possible to do a backup or a restore
even if a few partners are down. The possible security attacks against
the system were novel and guarding against them was the hardest design
issue. We used challenges to ensure that the partners of a given machine
are keeping its backup data. To challenge a partner, a machine requests
a randomly chosen block of data from that partner and checks it is the
right block. Also, we had to impose several rules to ensure the cooperation
of the partners and to prevent any partner from gaining any benefit if
it does not apply the rules. For example, to prevent an attacker from exploiting
one machine after the other, we imposed a commitment cost whenever a machine
acquires a new partner. The machine pays the commitment cost by being forced
to store its partners' data for a certain period of time without any guarantee
that it can restore its own data. We ended our study with profiling the
prototype system. We found out that the costs of encryption, computing
the secure hash, and applying erasure codes are much less than what we
had expected.
<p><b>3 SRC</b>
<p>I found SRC to be an exciting environment, full of very friendly, cooperative
and brilliant people. The research taking place at SRC is very interesting
and there is a prevailing mutual spirit of cooperation and integration
among the different research groups. I had the chance to work closely with
many smart people at SRC. Also, SRC is in downtown Palo Alto, which is
a very lively place and I enjoyed a lot of fine restaurants and shopping
places. In addition, I had the chance to visit other research labs in the
Silicon Valley (e.g., Xerox PARC, HP Labs, IBM Almaden and Sun Labs).
