<td><b>1 Introduction</b>
<p>Houdini is a static program checking tool that helps uncover potential
run-time errors in Java programs. Among other kinds of errors, it can detect
array bound overflows, null dereferences, and division by zero. Houdini
is based on an earlier program checker developed at SRC called ESC/Java.
While ESC/Java expects the methods in its input programs to be annotated
with a sufficient number of pre and post conditions, Houdini drops this
requirement and attempts to perform useful analysis even when given unannotated
input programs.
<p>Initially, Houdini was prototyped using a shell script that iteratively
modified the text of the input program and repeatedly called ESC/Java.
This prototype was useful in verifying the Houdini approach, but was quite
inefficient. Our project goals were to redesign Houdini's architecture
to be more independent of ESC/Java and to develop Houdini-specific optimization
techniques. The rest of this document describes the original implementation
of Houdini and several optimizations introduced by our project.
<p><b>2 Initial Houdini Prototype</b>
<p>The initial version of Houdini works in two stages. First, it guesses
a set of preconditions and postconditions for every method in the input
program and inserts them directly in the program. Then, it uses ESC/Java
to figure out which of the guessed annotations are incorrect. ESC/Java
works by converting each annotated method into a formula called verification&nbsp;&nbsp;
condition and sending it to the theorem prover Simplify which, in turn,
returns a list of incorrect annotations. Houdini then removes these incorrect
annotations from the program. Since removing one annotation may cause subsequent
annotations to become invalid, Houdini repeats this process until it settles
on an appropriate set of annotations. At this point Houdini invokes ESC/Java
one final time in order to check the program with respect to the inferred
set of annotations. The diagram in figure 1 shows the architecture of this
initial version of Houdini.
<p><b>3 Guarded Verification Conditions</b>
<p>One inefficiency of the above approach is that it involves repeated
generation of verification conditions from the same methods. Instead we
can create a special kind of verification condition, called a <i>guarded
verification condition (GVC)</i>, just once when Houdini is started. We
introduce a unique guard variable for each annotation guessed by Houdini.
The GVC of a method has the property that when we substitute true for a
guard variable in the GVC, the resulting formula is equivalent to the verification
condition produced ESC/Java when the corresponding annotation is present
in the program. In addition, when we substitute
<center>

<br><i>Figure 1: Original Houdini Architecture</i></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>false for a guard variable, the resulting formula is equivalent to the
verification condition generated when the corresponding annotation is not
present in the program.
<p>To implement the above idea, we first modified ESC/Java to produce guarded
verification condition. The new Houdini implementation maintains a truth
value assignment for each guard variable depending on whether the corresponding
annotations has been refuted so far. At each iteration, the implementation
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
substitutes for the guard variables according to the truth assignment</li>

<li>
performs basic simplifications on the obtained formula</li>

<li>
and sends the optimized verification condition directly to Simplify</li>
</ul>
The new architecture uses ESC/Java only in its initial stage of generating
GVCs and in the final stage of checking the program with respect to the
inferred set of annotations. The rest of Houdini is autonomous. Eliminating
the need in parsing Java methods and generating verification conditions
repeatedly resulted in a substantial performance increase. The new design
is described by the diagram in figure 2.
<p><b>4 Optimizations</b>
<p>Our implementation of Houdini employs many other optimizations. A lot
of them are too detailed to be introduced in this short document. We focus
only on two main optimizations in this section.
<p><b>4.1 Fine Grained Optimization</b>
<p>The basic simplifications mentioned in the previous section are local;
they do not exploit the knowledge about verification conditions gained
by Houdini over several iterations of substituting and sending them to
Simplify. For example, suppose at some point after substituting for guards
a verification condition has the
<center><img SRC="gvc.jpg" BORDER=0 height=340 width=706>
<br><i>Figure 2: GVC Architecture</i></center>

<p>form P ^ Q and turns out to be valid. If at a later iteration after
substitution, we find that the verification condition for the same method
is of the form P ^ Q', we can simplify it to just Q' since we know that
P is valid. <i>Fine grained optimization</i> is a generalization of this
basic idea.&nbsp;
<p><b>4.2 Distributed Implementation</b>
<p>Finally, we notice that Simplify is the performance bottleneck of the
system and that running Simplify on a verification condition is self-contained.
Hence, it is natural to distribute this task over multiple processes. We
achieve such distribution by running a central controller and multiple
worker processes on different processors and exchanging data between the
controller and workers over sockets. The distributed architecture is shown
in figure 3.
<p><b>5 Conclusion</b>
<p>The initial Houdini version successfully inferred annotations for a
37,000 line program taking more than 60 hours. The new version incorporating
the above as well as many other optimizations performed the same task in
a little over 1 hour. We ran the experiment in a 12 worker configuration
and the parallelization gave us a factor of&nbsp; 7 speedup. Guarded verification
conditions accounted for a factor of 2 improvement. Surprisingly, fine
grained optimization did not result in any measurable performance gain.
The rest of the improvement came from additional optimizations not discussed
here.
