<td>I spent my internship at SRC working on aspects of the Swift compiler
with Keith Randall. A paper on this work is forthcoming.&nbsp; Here is
the abstract from that paper:
<p>We present an extension of field analysis called "related field analysis"
which is a general technique for proving relationships between two or more
fields of an object.&nbsp; We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability
of related field analysis by applying it to the problem of removing array
bounds checks.&nbsp; For array bounds check removal, we define a pair of
related fields to be an integer field and an array field for which the
integer field has a known relationship to the length of the array.&nbsp;
This related field information can then be used to remove array bounds
checks from accesses to the array field.&nbsp; Our results show that related
field analysis can remove an average of 50% of the dynamic array bounds
checks on a wide range of applications.
<p>We describe the implementation of related field analysis in the Swift
optimizing compiler for Java, as well as the optimizations that exploit
the results of related field analysis.
