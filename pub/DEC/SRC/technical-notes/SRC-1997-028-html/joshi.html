<P>This page describes a summer project undertaken by Rajeev Joshi (UT
Austin) while a summer intern at SRC, summer 1997, hosted by <A
HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/people/Rustan_Leino">Rustan
Leino</A>. </P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The goal of <A HREF="Esc.html">Extended Static Checking</A> (ESC) is
to check, at compile time, for common runtime errors, e.g., dereferencing
a <TT>nil</TT> pointer, accessing an array out of bounds. Given a program
annotated with a specification, an ESC compiler produces a <I>verification
condition</I>, a predicate in first-order logic, which expresses that the
program meets the given specification. This verification condition is then
given to a theorem prover, which checks whether or not it is valid. In
most cases, the prover is expected to report either that the condition
is valid or that it is invalid (and then also provide an error context);
in some cases, the prover may just give up. </P>

<P>My project this summer (under Rustan Leino) was to study some of the
difficulties that arise in reasoning about programs with recursive data
structures such as linked lists. To track our progress, we chose an example
based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for generating primes; the
example seems to be fairly representative of the class of programs we were
interested in. Over the course of the summer, we manually sketched a proof
of correctness of this program and determined that we needed to modify
one of the original axioms, as the prover is not equipped with induction.
I also extended Rustan's ESC/<A
HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Rustan_Leino/papers.h
tml#krml65">Ecstatic</A>
compiler to generate appropriate verification conditions for programs with
data abstraction and simple recursive data types. We then tried running
the prover on the resulting conditions and found that, with the exception
of one axiom schema which we had to instantiate ourselves, the entire example
could be checked automatically. </P>

<P>In the remainder of this note, I shall give a brief introduction to
ESC and describe the problem that I worked on during the summer. </P>

<H2>Background</H2>

<P>Consider the following sample specification:</P>

<PRE>    class Rational
    {       field num, den : integer
       spec field ok : boolean = (den # 0)
    }

    procedure normalise(r : Rational)
    {   pre       r.ok
        modifies  r.num, r.den
        post      r.num * r.den' = r.num' * r.den
    }</PRE>

<P>Class <TT>Rational</TT> has three fields: two integer fields representing
the numerator and the denominator, and a <I>specification field</I>, whose
value is a function of the values of other fields. In ESC jargon, the specification
field is said to <I>depend</I> on the fields of which it is a function.
In the example above, for all objects <TT>r</TT> of type <TT>Rational</TT>,
we have that <TT>r.ok</TT> depends on <TT>r.den</TT> . </P>

<P>The specification of procedure <TT>normalise</TT> has three clauses
which refer, in order, to the precondition, the modification list, and
the postcondition respectively. The precondition is a first-order predicate
which is assumed to hold upon entry into the procedure; it is expected
to be established by the caller. The postcondition is a first-order predicate
which is required to hold upon exit from the procedure body; it relates
unprimed variables (denoting variable values upon entry) and primed variables
(denoting variable values upon exit) and it is expected to be satisfied
by the procedure implementation. The modification list describes the variables
that the implementation is allowed to modify; it is translated into predicates,
called <I>modification constraints</I>, which are conjoined to the postcondition.
</P>

<P>Informally speaking, a modification constraint asserts that the value
of a field (such as <TT>den</TT> above) changes only in those objects where
the procedure is allowed to modify it. Modification lists may mention specification
fields; in such cases, the list is first <I>desugared</I> (i.e., rewritten)
into another list before modification constraints are generated. The rules
for desugaring modification lists are somewhat complex -- they are based
on engineering decisions intended to make them easier for programmers to
use -- but, to get some idea of how they work, consider the modification
list </P>

<PRE>    modifies r.ok</PRE>

<P>for the example above. This list would be desugared into </P>

<PRE>    modifies r.ok , r.den</PRE>

<P>which produces the following modification constraints, where <TT>s</TT>
ranges over objects of type <TT>Rational</TT>: </P>

<PRE>    (All s :: s.ok = s.ok'    \/  s = r)
    (All s :: s.den = s.den'  \/  s = r)
    (All s :: s.num = s.num')</PRE>

<P>In more complex examples in which several levels of abstraction are
layered one on top of another, desugaring a modification list typically
involves computing a transitive closure of the dependency relation. </P>

<H2>Cyclic Dependencies</H2>

<P>To understand the difficulties that may arise with recursive data structures,
consider the following definition of a linked list: </P>

<PRE>    class List
    {       field value : integer
            field next : List
       spec field valid : boolean = (value # 0  /\  (next = nil \/ next.valid))
    }

    procedure Init(l : List)
    {   modifies  l.valid
        post      l.valid'
    }</PRE>

<P>Note that the declaration of field <TT>valid</TT> introduces the following
dependency:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>for all objects <TT>l</TT> of type <TT>List</TT> , <TT>l.valid</TT>
depends on <TT>l.next.valid</TT> . </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Such a dependency of a specification field (<TT>valid</TT> at object
<TT>l</TT>) on itself (<TT>valid</TT> at object <TT>l.next</TT>) is called
a <I>cyclic dependency</I>. A preliminary difficulty with cyclic dependencies
is finding a compact representation for modification lists. Recall that
desugaring typically requires computing the transitive closure of the dependency
relation. In the presence of cyclic dependencies, this closure is no longer
finite. For instance, a naive desugaring of the modification list for procedure
<TT>Init</TT> above yields </P>

<PRE>    modifies l.valid, l.next.valid, l.next.next.valid, ...
             l.value, l.next.value, l.next.next.value, ...
             l.next, l.next.next, l.next.next.next, ...</PRE>

<P>so we need a way to represent such infinite sets succinctly. A simple
solution is to use a closure operator &quot;<TT>*</TT>&quot; (pronounced
&quot;star&quot;) which denotes &quot;0 or more occurrences of&quot; ;
then, the modification list above may be written as</P>

<PRE>    modifies l.next*.valid, l.next*.value, l.next*.next .</PRE>

<P>The next difficulty is to determine how to generate appropriate modification
constaints for such expressions. A naive translation of </P>

<PRE>    modifies l.next*.value</PRE>

<P>would give </P>

<PRE>    (All s :: s.value = s.value'  \/  (s \in l.next*)) .</PRE>

<P>Since the prover is not equipped to reason about such closures, we rewrite
the second disjunct using a 4-argument predicate <TT>REACH</TT>, introduced
in 1983 by <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/people/Greg_Nelson">Greg
Nelson</A> (who also provided a set of useful axioms for it). Informally
speaking, <TT>(REACH u z f x)</TT> asserts that it is possible to reach
object <TT>z</TT> from object <TT>u</TT> by following the pointer field
<TT>f</TT>, without ever following the <TT>f</TT> pointer of object <TT>x</TT>.
For the example above, the modification constraint would be written as</P>

<PRE>    (All s :: s.value = s.value'  \/  (REACH l s next nil) ) .</PRE>

<H2>Some Discoveries</H2>

<P>In proving the Sieve of Eratosthenes example, we found that we needed
only two axioms about <TT>REACH</TT> (viz., A1 and A2 from Nelson's paper).
We also discovered that we had to modify the <I>pointwiseness axiom</I>
schema for cyclic dependencies (due to Dave Detlefs), which, for the example
above, yielded</P>

<PRE>    (All s ::
       (All w : w # nil  /\  (REACH s w next nil)
              : w.value = w.value'  /\   w.next = w.next')
    ==&gt;
       s.valid = s.valid' )</PRE>

<P>We found that, since the prover is not equipped for induction, this
axiom was not enough to prove even the following simple Hoare triple (due
to <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/people/Jim_Saxe">Jim Saxe</A>):</P>

<PRE>      { s.valid  /\  s # t  /\  (REACH s t next nil)  /\  t.valid }
    t.next := nil
      { s.valid }</PRE>

<P>Our new axiom schema now yields</P>

<PRE>    (All s ::
       (All w : w # nil  /\  (REACH s w next nil)
              :    (w.value = w.value'  /\  w.next = w.next')
                \/ w.valid = w.valid' )
    ==&gt;
       s.valid = s.valid' )</PRE>

<P>which seems sufficient, at least for the examples we have considered.
</P>

<H2>Future Work</H2>

<P>There are at least two directions for future work. The first is to study
programs with recursive data structures in which more than one field is
involved in the recursion. (An example is a binary tree, with pointers
for left- and right- children.) This involves generalising the <TT>REACH</TT>
predicate to accept a relation (or a set of fields) as its third argument.
Since we have used only 2 axioms about <TT>REACH</TT> so far, this extension
may turn out to be reasonably straightforward. The second direction of
research is to find sufficient conditions under which users may not introduce
inconsistencies into the checker. Currently, as pointed out by Jim Saxe,
it is possible to introduce an inconsistency by using cyclic dependencies.
As an example, consider changing the definition of <TT>valid</TT> to</P>

<PRE>    spec field valid : boolean = (value # 0  /\  (next = nil  \/ 
~next.valid))</PRE>

<P>where <TT>~</TT> denotes negation. Suppose initially that there is only
one object <TT>t</TT>, whose <TT>value</TT> field is nonzero and whose
<TT>next</TT> field is <TT>nil</TT>. Then the assignment </P>

<PRE>    t.next := t</PRE>

<P>introduces an inconsistency, since now there is no solution to the recursive
equation in <TT>valid</TT>. </P>
