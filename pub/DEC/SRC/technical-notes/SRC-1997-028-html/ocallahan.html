<h2>Background</h2>

I'm a third year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon. My work is primarily in
large-scale program analysis tools. I chose SRC because I thought it
would be a fun place to spend a summer and it has many interesting
people and projects. I was looking forward to getting experience working
as part of a group, and at doing something a little different from my
main line of work.<P>

<h2>The Project</h2>

The Digital Continuous Profiling Infrastructure (DCPI) is a suite of tools
that performs sample-based profiling with very low overhead. The
profiles cover the entire system, including the kernel, and the system
is very convenient to set up and operates transparently. There are many
tools for reviewing the data, including tools that estimate execution
frequencies, average instruction stall times and reasons for those
stalls. Thus DCPI gives the user access to a lot of information at the
level of entire binaries right down to individual instructions.<P>

One problem with the system is that there are many distinct tools used
to view and interpret the data, and these tools are not integrated.
Furthermore, they are mostly text-based, which limits the ways
information can be displayed, and they mostly do not give the user ways
to interact with the data. Therefore I was given the job of creating a
graphical user interface that would: <P> 
<ol>
<li> subsume the displays of most of the tools
<li> use graphics to increase the density of information
display and make the interface easier to use
<li> provide interaction and integration so that all features would be easily
accessible.
</ol><P>

<h2>Approach</h2>

I created a Java application that communicates with the DCPI libraries
using HTTP. The libraries are packaged up into a CGI server that answers
queries sent by the application. The resulting Java application can be
run on any JVM, including inside a Web browser, and can view profile
data from any machine on the network.<P>

For the interface itself, I used Scott Hudson's Subarctic toolkit. This
is basically a widget library on top of AWT that provides easy handling
of common input behaviours such as dragging, a constraint system that
provides powerful ways to position UI elements dynamically, and some
other useful hacks such as double-buffering.<P>

When designing the interface, we focused on a few design principles. One
was consistency. We made globally consistent choices of colors for
different elements (e.g. cycle counts). Globally choosing scales is
impractical because the scales of instruction counts can be orders of
magnitude different from the scales of counts for entire programs, so we
chose scales to be consistent within windows but not necessarily between
windows. Of course, we followed standard guidelines in trying to make
all the UI widgets behave in similar (and generally familiar) ways.<P>

Another principle was configurability. Colors, fonts, sizes and
orientations of almost everything in the interface can be easily
modified by the user, often by directly manipulating the interface
itself using the mouse.<P>

Another principle was economy. The display is organised as a set of
views of five different kinds (lists of binary images, lists of
procedures, lists of basic blocks, listings of entire procedures, and
control-flow graphs of entire procedures). Each view displays a limited
amount of data about just the objects in that view. More details about
objects in the view can be obtained by holding the mouse cursor steady
over an object; a temporary "tip" will pop up to display the
information. Furthermore, when the user clicks on an object in one view
to highlight it, other views will automatically scroll to and highlight
any related objects. Thus the multiple views work together to display
more information.<P>

<h2>Results</h2>


It was fun to build the system and try out different ways of displaying
the data. We learned that simple displays were often the best fit for
people's needs. While complex visualizations could have looked prettier,
in this case they don't seem to be required.<P>

Subarctic encourages the programmer to use the "structured graphics"
model, where each graphical element has an underlying widget. Thus, in
applications such as Vis that can have thousands of data items to
display, the number of widgets can become very large. This can easily
lead to performance problems due to the large amount of space and time
required to manage these data structures. In Vis, these problems are
barely manageable. An interesting question (outside the scope of my
work) is whether there is a way to maintain the ease of programming and code
reuse that derive from the structured graphics model while eliminating
the need for huge data structures that cause the performance
problems.<P>

In order to get the tool to work acceptably on large data sets, we had
to do a fair amount of tuning. It turned out that different Java VMs
have greatly different performance characteristics; relative speeds vary
a lot depending on the kind of code being executed. In other words, in
addition to the architectural innovations that make performance ever
harder to understand, we now have an extra software layer that also adds
to the problem, and the number of architecture/VM combinations is
significantly larger than the number of architectures.

<h2>Future Work</h2>

Some of the lower-level lessons I learned, such as how large Java programs
are structured and how their performance can behave, will help me in my
work at CMU as I apply my program analysis techniques to Java. I hope
that the Vis tool itself will be used by the DCPI group and its users.
As DCPI evolves, the tool will need to be updated; in particular, when
new kinds of information become available, new views may have to be
created.<P>
