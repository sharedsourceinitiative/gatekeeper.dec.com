I've just finished my third year of graduate school at U.C. Berkeley,
where I study electrical engineering.  I work with Martin Vetterli and
Steve McCanne, and my general interests concern signal processing and
networks.  Specifically, I've been studying the use of Forward Error
Correction for real-time audio over the Internet.  Various Internet
audio tools (e.g. rat, freephone) have added extra redundancy to their
audio streams to protect against packet loss. I'm interested in trying
to determine how much redundancy to add, and also in determining how
things change as network conditions (e.g. traffic distributions)
change.  In the near future I'll be studying similar issues with
video.<P>

While at SRC, I worked on attaching small cameras to SHARKs (the 
Digital Network Appliance Reference Design).  The
sensors for these cameras are made from a standard CMOS process (as
opposed to a traditional CCD sensor), and so they can be fully
integrated with other logic on a single board.  Other advantages over
CCD systems include low price (only $15-$20 for one of these camera
sensors and a plastic lens, when purchased in quantity) and low power
(between 250 and 375 milliwatts).  Mark Hayter and I originally envisioned my
project as studying image and video processing algorithms on the
StrongARM microprocessor using a SHARK connected to one of these cameras.  However,
when I started work this summer much needed to be
done before the camera could send video to a SHARK.  As such, my summer was
spent working on the following elements:<P>

<OL>

<LI> Writing device drivers for two different CMOS sensors.</li>

The camera sensors were connected to a rev 1 SHARK through its ROM
card slot.  A board consisting of an ADC, a pair of dual FIFOs, and a
PAL acted as a bridge between the sensor and the SHARK' ROM card.
Device drivers were written in C, and accessed the camera and FIFOs
through memory mapped addresses on the SHARK.  The camera sensors'
configuration data is read and written via an I2C serial bus
interface; the driver I wrote included code to handle this serial
communication.<P>

<LI> Porting the UCB multicast tools to SHARK.</LI>

I ported UCB MASH multicast toolkit and got the shared media board
(mb) and video conferencing tool (vic) to run on a SHARK.  With vic
you can display refreshing video locally and also multicast it to other
workstations.  Because simply displaying the video on the local
machine with the camera still involves doing an encode and decode for
each frame, the video frame rate was only about two frames per second
(fps).<P>

<LI> Adapted a simpler Tcl/Tk display program for displaying video.</li>

Using a program Mark Hayter had written for displaying video from one
of these sensors on a Lectrice, a tablet-based computer, I modified it to work 
on SHARKS with
my device driver.  Its simplicity allowed me to study where time was
being spent to process and display video, as well as display video
faster than vic (by the end of the summer we had about 4 fps using
this program).  I also adapted Tk widgets to controls various camera
parameters, like ADC gain, black calibration levels, and color
balance.<P>

<LI> Improving picture quality.</li>

The initial video out of the analog VV5426 camera sensor we used was quite
noisy.  The noise came from the power supply interfering with the ADC,
and this was solved by moving on to the VV5404 digital sensor.  This
one took advantage of the CMOS nature of the sensor to put an ADC
right on the board with the sensor.  The resulting picture was noise
free and extremely sharp.  However, the color was rather unattractive,
and using the Tcl/Tk program I was able to determine that the red and
blue levels needed to be boosted, while the green levels should be
reduced.  Other parameters like black levels and gain were varied and
used to further improve picture quality.<P>

<LI> Performance optimizations.</li>

Finally, I was able to study the performance of the camera. 
One of the areas I focused on was
the color extraction process.  The CMOS camera sensors consist of an
array of alternating color filters (one line has RGRGRG..., while the
next has GBGBGB..., and back to RGRGRG, where R=red, G=green, and
B=blue) in front of light sensors.  In order to obtain a full color
picture, the software supplied with the cameras uses a Bayer algorithm
to interpolate the missing colors.  However, even though you start off
with one-third of the color information you need (one half of the green 
and one-quarter each of the red and blue), the full-color output image is offset from
the camera input image by one-half a pixel in the X and Y directions,
so that every output pixel requires that all three colors be averaged.
I implemented a simpler symmetric filter which uses only
shifts and adds, and reduced the color interpolation time by 33%.  I
also saved time in the next step of image extraction, a high-frequency
emphasis filter, by removing some unnecessary thresholding checks and
hard-coding in color gains.
</ol><P>

The most fun part of this project was getting the digital sensor
working with corrected color and seeing good quality images come into
the SHARK through a $20 camera.  One of the most challenging aspects
of the project was working with the sensors, for I was dealing with
extremely limited documentation.  This meant that I had to reverse
engineer the vendor software and some of their data modes in order to
determine functionality.  It also meant finding and debugging
inaccuracies in supplied data sheets.  Dealing with SHARKs was also
rewarding and fun, because their capabilities and state of development
frequently amazed me, but also challenging because they were still
prototypes.  All in all I found this to be a
very rewarding project, and a great opportunity to work at SRC and
interact with so many talented and capable people.<P>
