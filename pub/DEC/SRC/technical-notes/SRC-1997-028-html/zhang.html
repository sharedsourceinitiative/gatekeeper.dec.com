<h2>Introduction</h2>

I am a third year Ph.D. student at Harvard University where I work
with Brad Chen on the Morph project.  Morph is a system that aims to
provide a framework for automatically monitoring and optimizing
software that runs on an end user's computer.  I have developed the
Morph Continuous Monitor that monitors the execution of the
application by sampling the PC (program counter) of the executable.
The samples collected by the Monitor are then fed to a profile-driven
optimizer.<P>

I was an intern from August 23 to November 21; Mark Vandevoorde was my
host.  I chose SRC for internship because of its excellence in
computer science research and the high reputation of its intern
program.<P>


<h2>SRC project</h2>

While at SRC, I worked on comparing an Alpha 21164 (Miata) NT system
with a PentiumII NT system using the DCPI (Digital Continuous
Profiling Infrastructure) tools.  The goal was to
figure out why some applications run faster on one system than the
other and try to look for ways to improve applications running on the
Alpha NT system.<P>  

<h2>Experimental Setup</h2>

The two systems we compared were a 500 MHz Alpha 21164 EV56 (Miata)
system and a 266MHz PentiumII system.  The applications we studied were
the BAPCo SYSmark NT4.0, Aladdin ghostscript 5.0.3, and MicroSoft
SQLServer 6.5 running the TPC-B benchmark as the workload.<P>

For performance analysis, we used the aggregate event counts collected
using DCPI and the DCPI tools that provide instruction level stall
analysis (Alpha version only).  Ntprof was used to discover unaligned
loads.  For (manual) optimizations, we used the NT Atom
instrumentation tool to perform binary rewriting.<P>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Overall performance</h3>

In terms of running times of the benchmarking programs, the
performance of the two systems are pretty close except for Ghostscript
and PowerPoint.  For Ghostscript, the Miata is much faster.  PowerPoint is
a 16-bit Windows application and is interpreted on Alpha, which
results in a much slower running time.<P>

One interesting finding is that the number of PentiumII micro-ops (one
Intel CISC instruction is decoded into RISC-like micro-ops before
execution) and the number of Alpha RISC instructions are pretty
comparable.  For system code, the number of PentiumII micro-ops are
consistenly larger by a small fraction.<P>

We also discovered that for the BAPCo SYSmark programs, the
instruction cache performance for PentiumII system is much better than
the Alpha, which is responsible for a large fraction of the
stalls for Excel and Word.<P>

For SQLServer 6.5, both systems performed similarly because the server
was not CPU-bound.  We also discovered that the Alpha version was
compiled for debugging!<P>

<h3>Detailed Examples</h3>

<ul>

<li>Case 1: We identified an unaligned load in ghostscript for Alpha NT
that is responsible for 29% of the total cycles, and we worked with Peter
Deutsch to fix the problem.  The fix will appear in the next release
of Alladin Ghostscript.<P>

<LI>Case 2: We identified a misuse of mb instruction in the Alpha mga
device driver which is responsible for 16% of the total cycles for
ghostscript.  A driver that is optimized for Alpha can be downloaded
from the Digital Web site which fixes this problem.<P>

<LI>Case 3: A simple prefetching optimization on Texim improves running
time by 9%.<P>

</ul>

<h2>The fun and challenging parts</h2>

A challenging part of the project was to work with tools that were not
yet stable and to provide useful feedback to the authors to help
improve the tools.  I have learned a great deal about hardware
architectures and Windows NT.<P>
