I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of California in Irvine,
working with Michael Franz on a new operating system that reconciles the
advantages of portable executables with high performance. For portable
executables, most of the traditional optimizations cannot be performed at
compile time any longer, resulting in serious performance problems. This
flaw can only be overcome by delaying optimization until runtime (or load
time) and enriching current operating systems with runtime optimization
infrastructures. Our new operating system implements such an infrastructure
and continuously and gradually optimizes programs in the background or on
specific request of the programmer. It also utilizes an adaptive profiler
to custom-tailor optimizations towards system- and user-behavior. <P>

At SRC this summer I have been working with Hannes Marais on the
implementation of WebL. WebL is a new Web scripting language that has been
designed to automate tasks such as retrieving Web documents, extracting
structured and unstructured data from Web documents (for example HTML-, and
XML-based Web pages), and creating and manipulating Web documents. 
One of the main problems that we were trying to solve this summer was the
design of an expressive, powerful and concise query language for
WebL that allows searching on the structure and on the flat text of HTML-
or XML-pages. Traditionally, approaches for searching in structured text
documents have focused on either searching documents by content (e.g.
searching with regular expressions) or by structure (e.g. subtree matching
or context-free grammar matching), but not both at the same time. Most of
the query languages also lack orthogonality and compositionality, and, in
most cases, do not allow the expression of overlapping of search results.
To overcome these problems, we developed a novel combined approach for
searching in Web documents that allows mixing content and structure in a
simple, orthogonal, and concise query language. Rather than being based on
trees or grammars, it is based on set algebra. The basic components of the
proposed search algebra are sets of pieces and set-operators. A piece is a
continuous region in the text that can either be constructed by searching
the text with a regular expression or searching for markup elements in the
structure. Set operators allow combining piece-sets to construct more
powerful queries. WebL currently supports a combination of structural,
positional, and basic set operators (e.g. in, contain, after, before,
union, etc.). <P>

One of the most important things that I learnt this summer is that the
design of a programming language is much more difficult than it would
appear when reading the final language specification. Finding the essence
of the problem and the right mix between simplicity and expressiveness is a
tedious process that involves a lot of discussion and often requires
starting from scratch again and discarding previous ideas and implementations.<P>
