This note informally describes the syntax and semantics of TLA+ down
to, but not including, the level of expressions.  Its main purpose is
to introduce and explain the constructs for including modules that
were introduced in August, 1996.

A TLA+ specification is organized as a collection of modules.  A
module looks like this:<A HREF="#Note1"> (Note 1)</A>
<PRE>
   ----------- MODULE DirectedGraphs ------------
    body                       
   ----------------------------------------------
    more body
   ==============================================
</PRE>

The body consists of a sequence of statements, where a statement is a
declaration, definition, assumption, or theorem.  We will ignore
assumptions and theorems for now.  Horizontal lines like
<PRE>
   ---------------------------------------------
</PRE>

can appear between statements; they are purely decorative.<P>

A declaration statement looks like this:
<PRE>
   CONSTANTS Node, Edge
</PRE>

It adds to the module the declarations of <TT>Node</TT> and <TT>Edge</TT> as
constant symbols.  TLA+ also allows variable symbols, identified by
the keyword "<TT>VARIABLES</TT>".<A HREF="#Note2"> (Note 2)</A> A declared
symbol is a "free parameter" of the module.<P>

A definition statement looks like this:
<PRE>
   NonEdge == (Node \X Node) \ Edge
</PRE>

Assuming that <TT>Edge</TT> and <TT>Node</TT> are declared as above, this
statements adds to the module the definition that defines the symbol
<TT>NonEdge</TT> to equal the expression
<PRE>
   (Node \X Node) \ Edge
</PRE>

We will not worry about the meaning of this and other expressions.<P>

We can follow this definition statement with the definition statement
<PRE>
   NonTrivialNonEdge == NonEdge \ {&lt;&lt;n, n&gt;&gt; : n \in Node}
</PRE>

This defines the symbol <TT>NonTrivialNonEdge</TT> to be the expression
<PRE>
   ((Node \X Node) \ Edge) \ {&lt;&lt;$n, $n&gt;&gt; : $n \in Node}
</PRE>

Observe that to obtain this definition, we replace the defined symbol
<TT>NonEdge</TT> by its definition, and we replace the bound variable
<TT>n</TT> with a new symbol <TT>$n</TT> that cannot be declared or defined by
the user.<P>

In this way, a definition always defines a symbol to equal an
expression containing only declared symbols, bound variables that are
different from any symbols typed by the user, and the built-in
operators of TLA+ like <TT>\X</TT> and <TT>\</TT>.<P>

Symbols can also be defined to equal operators that take
arguments.<A HREF="#Note3"> (Note 3)</A> For example,
<PRE>
   Nbrs(n, m) == &lt;&lt;n, m&gt;&gt; \in Edge
</PRE>

defines the symbol <TT>Nbrs</TT> to be an operator that
assigns to any expressions <TT>exp_1</TT> and <TT>exp_2</TT> the
expression
<PRE>
   &lt;&lt;exp_1, exp_2&gt;&gt; \in  Edge
</PRE>

We will denote this operator 
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $n, $m : &lt;&lt;$n, $m&gt;&gt; \in \ Edge
</PRE>

We use <TT>LAMBDA</TT> only to describe the semantics of modules; it is
not an operator of TLA+.  (As before, we replaced the bound variables
<TT>n</TT> and <TT>m</TT> by "untypable" symbols <TT>$n</TT> and
<TT>$m</TT>.)<A HREF="#Note4"> (Note 4)</A><P>

TLA+ allows you to define prefix, infix, and postfix operators.  For
example, writing
<PRE>
   n ?? m == &lt;&lt;n, m&gt;&gt; \in Edge
</PRE>

defines the infix operator <TT>??</TT> to be the same as the ordinary
operator <TT>Nbrs</TT>.<A HREF="#Note5"> (Note 5)</A><P>

In a definition, the expression to the right of the "<TT>==</TT>" can
contain only TLA+ primitives, symbols that have already been defined
or declared, and definition parameters (for example, the symbols
<TT>n</TT> and <TT>m</TT> in the definition of <TT>Nbrs</TT>).  Circular
definitions are not allowed.  (Recursive definitions will be discussed
elsewhere.)

<H3><A NAME="Section2">Including One Module in Another</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

One builds large hierarchical specifications by building a new module
"on top of" old modules.  One way to do this is with the
<TT>EXTENDS</TT> statement at the beginning of the module.  The statement
<PRE>
   EXTENDS Foo, Bar
</PRE>

simply adds the declarations and definitions from modules <TT>Foo</TT> and
<TT>Bar</TT><A HREF="#Note6"> (Note 6)</A> to the current module.  This has
approximately<A HREF="#Note7"> (Note 7)</A> the same effect as inserting the
body of those modules in the current module.<P>

The other way to use an existing module is with the <TT>INSTANCE</TT>
statement, which instantiates (substitutes for) the module's declared
symbols.  Suppose that module <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> declares the symbols
<TT>Node</TT> and <TT>Edge</TT>, and defines the symbols <TT>NonEdge</TT> and
<TT>Nbrs</TT>, as above.  Consider the following module:
<PRE>
   ------------------ MODULE SGraphs ------------------
   CONSTANT S

   Edge == { &lt;&lt;m, n&gt;&gt; \in S \X S : m \in n }

   INSTANCE DirectedGraphs WITH Node &lt;- S, Edge &lt;- Edge
   ====================================================
</PRE>

The <TT>INSTANCE</TT> statement adds to module <TT>SGraphs</TT> all
definitions obtained from the definitions of <TT>DirectedGrahs</TT> by
substituting <TT>S</TT> for the symbol <TT>Node</TT> and substituting the
definition of <TT>Edge</TT> (from module <TT>SGraphs</TT>) for the symbol
<TT>Edge</TT>.  Thus, the <TT>INSTANCE</TT> statement adds the following
definitions to module <TT>SGraphs</TT>:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>NonEdge</TT> is defined to equal
<PRE>
   (S \X S) \ { &lt;&lt;$m, $n&gt;&gt; \in S \X S : $m \in $n }
</PRE>

<LI> <TT>Nbrs</TT> is defined to equal
<PRE>
LAMBDA $n, $m : &lt;&lt;$n, $m&gt;&gt; \in 
                  { &lt;&lt;$m, $n&gt;&gt; \in S \X S : $m \in $n }
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>

Substitutions such as <TT>Edge &lt;- Edge</TT>, in which a symbol is
substituted for itself, are quite common.  We therefore introduce the
convention that if no substitution for a declared symbol <TT>s</TT> of an
instantiated module appears in the <TT>WITH</TT> clause, then there is an
implicit <TT>s &lt;- s</TT>.  (This means that <TT>s</TT> must already be
declared or defined in the current module.)  Thus, the <TT>INSTANCE</TT>
statement of module <TT>SGraphs</TT> above can be written
<PRE>
   INSTANCE DirectedGraphs WITH Node &lt;- S
</PRE>

If there are no explicit substitutions, the "<TT>WITH</TT>" is omitted.<P>

A module may need to use more than one instantiation of the same
module.  For example, we may want to use two different instances of
the <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> module, with different substitutions for the
parameters <TT>Node</TT> and <TT>Edge</TT>.  We can't let the same symbol have
two different definitions, so we must rename the defined symbols.  The
statement
<PRE>
   Foo == INSTANCE DirectedGraphs WITH Node &lt;- S 
</PRE>

is the same as the <TT>INSTANCE</TT> statement in module <TT>SGraphs</TT>
above except that it defines the symbols <TT>Foo.NonEdge</TT> and
<TT>Foo.Nbrs</TT> instead of the symbols <TT>NonEdge</TT> and
<TT>Nbrs</TT>.<A HREF="#Note8"> (Note 8)</A><P>

Sometimes we need to use a whole family of instantiations of the same
module.  We do this as indicated by the following example:
<PRE>
   E(Set) == { &lt;&lt;T1, T2&gt;&gt; \in (SUBSET Set) \X (SUBSET Set)
                 : T1 \subseteq T2 }

   DG(S) == INSTANCE DirectedGraphs 
              WITH Node &lt;- SUBSET S, Edge &lt;- E(S)
</PRE>

(<TT>T1</TT> and <TT>T2</TT> are bound variables in the first definition.)
For any expression <TT>exp</TT>, this defines <TT>DG(exp).NonEdge</TT> to
equal the expression obtained from the definition of <TT>NonEdge</TT> in
the <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> module by substituting <TT>SUBSET S</TT> for
<TT>Node</TT> and substituting the definition of <TT>E(exp)</TT> for
<TT>Edge</TT>.  In other words, <TT>DG(exp).NonEdge</TT> equals
<PRE>
   ((SUBSET exp) \X (SUBSET exp))
      \ { &lt;&lt;$T1, $T2&gt;&gt; \in (SUBSET exp) \X (SUBSET exp) 
          : $T1 \subseteq $T2 }
</PRE>

We can think of <TT>DG(exp).NonEdge</TT> as meaning <TT>DG.NonEdge(exp)</TT>,
where <TT>DG.NonEdge</TT> is defined to be
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $S : ((SUBSET $S) \X (SUBSET $S)) \ 
                 { &lt;&lt;$T1, $T2&gt;&gt; \in (SUBSET $S) \X (SUBSET $S) 
                   : $T1 \subseteq $T2 }
</PRE>

The <TT>INSTANCE</TT> statement above similarly defines
<TT>DG(exp_1).Nbrs(exp_2,exp_3)</TT> for any expressions <TT>exp_1</TT>,
<TT>exp_2</TT>, and <TT>exp_3</TT>.  Again, we can think of
<TT>DG(exp_1).Nbrs(exp_2,exp_3)</TT> as meaning
<TT>DG.Nbrs(exp_1)(exp_2,exp_3)</TT>, where <TT>DG.Nbrs</TT> is defined to be
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $S : LAMBDA $n, $m : 
      &lt;&lt;$n, $m&gt;&gt; \in { &lt;&lt;$T1, $T2&gt;&gt; \in (SUBSET $S) \X (SUBSET $S) 
                       : $T1 \subseteq $T2 }
</PRE>

To summarize:
<DL>
<DT><TT>EXTENDS M</TT><DD> 
Adds to the current module the declarations and definitions from
module <TT>M</TT>.<P>

<DT><TT>INSTANCE M WITH s_1 &lt;- exp_1, ...  , s_k &lt;- exp_k</TT><DD> The
<TT>s_i</TT> must be the declared symbols of module <TT>M</TT>.  (If <TT>k=0</TT>,
we omit the "<TT>WITH</TT>".  Omitting an explicit instantiation of a
declared symbol <TT>s</TT> from the <TT>WITH</TT> clause is equivalent to
adding the instantiation <TT>s &lt;- s</TT>.)  This <TT>INSTANCE</TT> expression
represents a mapping that assigns to each defined symbol <TT>ds</TT> a
definition <TT>ds_def</TT>, defined as follows.  Let <TT>EXP_i</TT> be the
expression obtained from <TT>exp_i</TT> by replacing every symbol defined
in the current module with its definition, and replacing bound
variables by new symbols.  We let <TT>ds_def</TT> equal the expression
obtained from the definition of <TT>ds</TT> in <TT>M</TT> by replacing each
declared symbol <TT>s_i</TT> with <TT>EXP_i</TT>.<P>

<UL>
<LI> If this instance expression appears as a statement by itself,
then each defined symbol <TT>ds</TT> of <TT>M</TT> is defined in the current
module to equal <TT>ds_def</TT>.<P>

<LI> If this instance expression appears in the statement <TT>IM(p_1,
..., p_j) == INSTANCE...</TT>, then <TT>IM.ds</TT> is defined to equal
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $p_1, ... , $p_j : DS_def
</PRE>

for each defined symbol <TT>ds</TT> of <TT>M</TT>, where <TT>DS_def</TT> is obtained
from <TT>ds_def</TT> by replacing each symbol <TT>p_i</TT> by the new symbol
<TT>$p_i</TT>.  We write <TT>IM(e_1, ... , e_j).ds</TT> instead of
<TT>IM.ds(e_1, ... , e_j)</TT>.  If <TT>j=0</TT>, we write
<TT>IM ==...</TT> and <TT>IM.ds</TT> instead of <TT>IM()==...</TT> and <TT>IM().ds</TT>.
</UL>
</DL>
The keyword <TT>INSTANCE</TT> can be followed by a comma-separated list of
instantiations, as in
<PRE>
   INSTANCE Naturals, Sequences
</PRE>

If a module <TT>M</TT> has no declared symbols, then <TT>EXTENDS M</TT> and
<TT>INSTANCE M</TT> are equivalent.  <TT>EXTENDS</TT> should be used only for
breaking up what is logically a single specification into smaller
pieces.  If <TT>M</TT> is a general-purpose module, <TT>INSTANCE M</TT> should
be used.

<H3><A NAME="Section3">Modules Inside Modules</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

One can put one module inside another, as in
<PRE>
   ------------- MODULE Outer ------------
   CONSTANT z 
   ...
      ----------- MODULE IMod -----------
      CONSTANT x, y
      ...
      ====================================

   Inner(x,y) == INSTANCE IMod
   ...
</PRE>

Module <TT>IMod</TT> is like any module, except that it can use the
declared symbol <TT>z</TT> and any other symbols declared or defined
before it in module <TT>Outer</TT>.  Module <TT>IMod</TT> may be used only
inside module <TT>Outer</TT>.<A HREF="#Note9"> (Note 9)</A><P>

Submodules such as <TT>IMod</TT> are often used in the following way.
Suppose we want to define
<PRE>
   Spec == \exists x, y : InnerSpec
</PRE>

where <TT>InnerSpec</TT> is some complicated formula involving <TT>x</TT> and
<TT>y</TT>.  The obvious way to do this is:
<PRE>
   CONSTANT x, y
   ...
   InnerSpec == ...
   Spec == \exists x, y : InnerSpec
</PRE>

However, the definition of <TT>Spec</TT> is illegal because it violates
the following syntactic rule of TLA+:
<UL>
<LI> A symbol that is already declared or defined cannot be used as a
bound variable.
</UL>
(The purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion between bound
variables and defined or declared symbols.)  We could write
<PRE>
   InnerSpec(x, y) == ...
   Spec == \exists x, y : InnerSpec(x,y)
</PRE>

However, <TT>InnerSpec</TT> may be defined in terms of a sequence of other
defined symbols, each of which is defined in terms of <TT>x</TT> and
<TT>y</TT>.  We would have to make <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> explicit parameters
of all those definitions.  Instead, using the module structure in the
example above, we can put the definition of InnerSpec in
submodule <TT>IMod</TT> and define
<PRE>
   Spec == \exists x, y : Inner(x, y).InnerSpec
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Section4">Local Definitions</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

It often happens that a module <TT>A</TT> extends modules <TT>B</TT> and
<TT>C</TT>, both of which extend module <TT>D</TT>.  For example, <TT>D</TT> might
declare symbols and make some definitions that are used by both <TT>B</TT>
and <TT>C</TT>.  Module <TT>A</TT> then obtains two copies of the definitions
and declarations of <TT>D</TT>--one obtained by extending <TT>B</TT> and the
other obtained by extending <TT>C</TT>.  TLA+ allows the same symbol to be
declared or defined two or more times, if the declarations or
definitions are the same.<A HREF="#Note10"> (Note 10)</A><P>

Adding more and more definitions with each level of module inclusion
will eventually lead to unintended name clashes.  We don't want to
know what modules are included by <TT>Naturals</TT> (the module that
defines the natural numbers and operators like <TT>+</TT>), so we need a
way to avoid name clashes with symbols defined by those modules.  TLA+
provides local definitions as a way of avoiding such name clashes.
Preceding a definition with the keyword <TT>LOCAL</TT> makes that
definition local to the current module.  For example, writing
<PRE>
   LOCAL Temp(x) == x + y
</PRE>

defines <TT>Temp</TT> in the current module.  But the definition of
<TT>Temp</TT> is not obtained by a module that includes the current
module--whether with <TT>EXTENDS</TT> or <TT>INSTANCE</TT>.
Similarly, writing
<PRE>
   LOCAL INSTANCE M WITH ...
</PRE>

or
<PRE>
   LOCAL Temp(x) == INSTANCE M WITH ...
</PRE>

makes all the definitions included from <TT>M</TT> local to the current
module.  <P>

Declarations cannot be made local.  Symbols are defined in terms of
declared symbols, and it wouldn't make sense to make a symbol local if
it appeared in a nonlocal definition.  (Remember that the statement
<TT>df == exp</TT> defines <TT>df</TT> to be the expression obtained from
<TT>exp</TT> by replacing defined symbols with their definitions, so the
definition of <TT>df</TT> has no defined symbols.)  Hence, one cannot
precede a declaration or an <TT>EXTENDS</TT> statement with
"<TT>LOCAL</TT>".  (Remember that <TT>EXTENDS M</TT> adds <TT>M</TT>'s declared
symbols to those of the current module.  If <TT>M</TT> declares no
symbols, one can write <TT>INSTANCE M</TT> instead of <TT>EXTENDS M</TT>.)<P>

When writing a general-purpose module, definitions included from other
modules should be made local.  For example, a general-purpose
<TT>Graphs</TT> module should include the <TT>Naturals</TT> module by
<PRE>
   LOCAL INSTANCE Naturals
</PRE>

That way, a module that includes <TT>Graphs</TT> can define <TT>+</TT> to mean
something other than addition of natural numbers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Section5">Higher-Order Operators</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Operators can take operators as arguments.  For example
<PRE>
   Double(A, F(_,_)) == F(A,A) 
</PRE>

defines <TT>Double</TT> to be an operator that takes two arguments---the
first of which is an expression, and the second of which is an
operator that takes two arguments, both of which are expressions.  For
example, <TT>Double(3,+)</TT> equals <TT>3+3</TT>, and <TT>Double({a},Nbrs)</TT>
equals <TT>Nbrs({a},{a})</TT>.<P>

TLA+ does not allow an operator to take as an argument an operator
that takes as an argument an operator.  In other words, there can be
at most two levels of parentheses to the left of the "<TT>==</TT>".  
One cannot define an operator that is any "higher-order" than
<TT>Double</TT>.<P>

The value of a TLA+ expression cannot be an operator; it must be a
simple value.  (A <TT>LAMBDA</TT> expression is one whose value is an
operator, but one cannot write <TT>LAMBDA</TT> expressions in TLA+.)<P>

One can declare constant symbols to be operators.  For example,
<PRE>
   CONSTANT Foo(_, _)
</PRE>

declares <TT>Foo</TT> to be an operator that takes two arguments.  Since
the value of an expression cannot be an operator, the declared
operator <TT>Foo</TT> can be instantiated only by an operator that has the
same number of arguments---for example, by writing
<PRE>
    INSTANCE ... WITH Foo &lt;- +
</PRE>

One cannot declare variable symbols to be operators.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Section6">Assumptions and Theorems</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

A module can contain assumptions and theorems, of the form <TT>ASSUME
exp</TT> and <TT>THEOREM exp</TT>, where <TT>exp</TT> is an expression.  The
expression <TT>exp</TT> can contain symbols declared or defined anywhere
in the module.<P>

For simplicity, suppose that module <TT>M</TT> contains only the single
assumption <TT>ASSUME a</TT> and the single theorem <TT>THEOREM t</TT>.  (The
generalization is obvious.)  Let <TT>A</TT> and <TT>T</TT> be the expressions
obtained from <TT>a</TT> and <TT>t</TT> by replacing all defined symbols with
their definitions, so the free variables of <TT>A</TT> and <TT>T</TT> are
declared symbols.  We make the syntactic requirement that <TT>A</TT>
contain only constant symbols.<A HREF="#Note11"> (Note 11)</A>
  Module <TT>M</TT> is <I>valid</I> iff
the formula <TT>A =&gt; T</TT> is valid.  Writing a module asserts that the
module is valid, so a theorem represents a proof obligation for the
writer of the module.<P>

When module <TT>M</TT> is included with an <TT>EXTENDS M</TT> statement, its
assumptions and theorems are added to those of the current module.
When module <TT>M</TT> is instantiated with an <TT>INSTANCE M</TT> expression,
only its definitions are added to the current module, not its
assumptions or theorems (or declared symbols).<P>

Suppose <TT>M</TT> is valid, so <TT>A =&gt; T</TT> is a valid formula.  
Suppose that the instantiation
<PRE>
   INSTANCE M WITH s_1 &lt;- exp_1, ...  , s_k &lt;- exp_k
</PRE>

is syntactically correct, meaning that every declared symbol of <TT>M</TT>
is instantiated with an expression all of whose symbols are defined or
declared.  Substitution preserves validity, so the formula obtained
from <TT>A =&gt; T</TT> by replacing each <TT>s_i</TT> with <TT>exp_i</TT> is valid.<P>

One often write modules with assumptions but no theorems.  These
assumptions serve no logical function, since they are not used to
prove anything (except perhaps if the module is extended by another
module).  However, they serve as useful comments to the reader about
the values one expects these symbols to assume.  For example,
one might add to module <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> the assumption
<PRE>
   ASSUME  Edge \subseteq Node \X Node
</PRE>

which indicates that one expects <TT>Edge</TT> to be a set of ordered
pairs of elements from the set <TT>Node</TT>.  We expect the assumption to
be satisfied when the module is instantiated, but we do not make this
a formal requirement.<A HREF="#Note12"> (Note 12)</A>

TLA extends "ordinary math" (first-order logic plus set theory) with
declared variable symbols and a few nonconstant operators.  The
nonconstant operators of TLA+ are 
<PRE>
   ~&gt; (leads-to)                   ' (prime)                    
   -+-&gt; (while)                    ENABLED   
   \cdot (action composition)      UNCHANGED 
   [...]_   (e.g., [A]_f)          \EE (temporal \exists)       
   &lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;_ (e.g., &lt;&lt;A&gt;&gt;_f)        \AA (temporal \forall)
   []     &lt;&gt;     WF     SF    
</PRE>

To define the semantics of TLA+, we take the following six to be
primitive and we define the rest in terms of them:
<PRE>
   '    ENABLED    \cdot    []    -+-&gt;    \EE
</PRE>

TLA places certain syntactic restrictions on the use of these
operators.  These restrictions are described in terms of <I>levels</I>.
Declared symbols and primitive TLA+ operators are assigned one of four
levels, listed below in increasing order:
<DL>
<DT>Constant Level<DD> Contains declared constant symbols and
constant-level TLA+ operators.<P>

<DT>State Level<DD> Contains declared variable symbols and the
<TT>ENABLED</TT> operator.<P>

<DT>Action Level<DD> Contains the operators <TT>'</TT> and <TT>\cdot</TT>.<P>

<DT>Temporal Level<DD> Contains the operators <TT>[]</TT>, 
<TT>-+-&gt;</TT>, and <TT>\EE</TT>.<P>

</DL>
The level of an expression is defined to be the level of its
highest-level subexpression, except that <TT>ENABLED A</TT> is a
state-level expression even when <TT>A</TT> is an action-level expression.
Note that in determining the level of a subexpression, bound variables
are considered to have constant level except that bound variables
introduced by the temporal quantifiers <TT>\EE</TT> and <TT>\AA</TT> are
state-level symbols.<P>

TLA places the following syntactic restrictions on expressions.
<UL>
<LI> The expression <TT>exp'</TT> is allowed only if <TT>exp</TT> is a
state-level or contant-level expression.<P>

<LI> A temporal-level expression 
is either 
<UL>
<LI> a constant-level or temporal-level operator applied to
constant-level, state-level, or temporal-level expressions.<P>

<LI> an expression having one of the the following forms
<PRE>
   [][A]_f    &lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;A&gt;&gt;_f    WF_f(A)    SF_f(A)
</PRE>

where <TT>A</TT> has at most action level and <TT>f</TT> has at most state
level.
</UL>
</UL>
These level restrictions place restrictions on the arguments of
defined operators.  For example, consider the operator <TT>S</TT> defined
by:
<PRE>
   S(U, V, x)  ==  U =&gt; Enabled (V \/ x')
</PRE>

The expression <TT>S(e_1, e_2, e_3)</TT> is legal iff expression <TT>e_2</TT>
has at most action level, and <TT>e_3</TT> has at most state level.  The
level of the complete expression is the maximum of the level of
<TT>e_1</TT> and state level.<A HREF="#Note13"> (Note 13)</A><P>

A constant-level module is one that has no declared variable symbols
and uses only constant-level operators.  Constant-level modules are
used for defining data structures and for describing "ordinary
math".<P>

We make the following rules for instantiation (by an <TT>INSTANCE</TT>
expression):
<UL>
<LI> Except when instantiating a constant-level module, a constant
symbol can be instantiated only by a constant-level expression.
(Arbitrary instantiations of declared symbols are allowed when
instantiating a constant-level module.)<P>

<LI> Variable symbols can be instantiated only by constant-level or
state-level expressions.
</UL>
These restrictions ensure that the instantiated modules satisfy the
syntactic level restrictions of TLA. They are also needed to ensure
that the instantiation of a valid module is valid.  For example, the
TLA formula <TT>[][c'=c]_c</TT> is valid (true for all behaviors) if
<TT>c</TT> is a declared constant symbol.  Substituting a variable for
<TT>c</TT> would produce an invalid formula (one that is false for some
behaviors).

<H3><A NAME="Section8">A Closer Look at Instantiation</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

We have stated that instantiation preserves validity.  If <TT>F</TT> is
defined in module <TT>M</TT> to equal a valid formula, and we write
<PRE>
    I == INSTANCE M WITH ...
</PRE>

then <TT>I.F</TT> is a valid formula.  Instantiation is substitution, and
in the presence of quantifiers, substitution preserves validity only
if it is defined properly.  In particular, substitution must be
defined so capture of free variables by quantifiers is not allowed.
For example, consider the valid formula <TT>\exists u : u /= v</TT>.
Naive substitution of <TT>u</TT> for <TT>v</TT> in this formula would
yield the invalid formula
 <TT>\exists u : u /= u</TT>.
Validity is not preserved because the free symbol <TT>u</TT>, which is
being substituted for <TT>v</TT>, is captured by the quantifier
<TT>\exists</TT>.<P>

The problem of capture of free variables by explicit quantifiers is
avoided in TLA+ by renaming bound variables.  The module
<PRE>
   ---------------- MODULE M ----------------
   CONSTANT v
   F == \exists u : u /= v
   ==========================================
</PRE>

defines <TT>F</TT> to be the formula
 <TT>\exists $u : $u /= v</TT>.
The statement
<PRE>
   I == INSTANCE M WITH v &lt;- u
</PRE>

then defines <TT>I.F</TT> to be the valid formula
 <TT>\exists $u : $u /= u</TT>.<P>

Some nonconstant operators of TLA+ contain implicit
quantification--most notably, the operator <TT>ENABLED</TT>.  Suppose module
<TT>M</TT> is 
<PRE>
   ---------------- MODULE M ----------------
   VARIABLE u, v
   F == ENABLED ((u' = u) /\ (v' /= v))
   ==========================================
</PRE>

Then <TT>F</TT> is a valid formula.  Now consider the statement
<PRE>
   I == INSTANCE M WITH u &lt;- x, v &lt;- x
</PRE>

A naive substitution would make <TT>I.F</TT> the formula
<PRE>
   ENABLED ((x' = x) /\ (x' /= x))
</PRE>

which is equivalent to <TT>FALSE</TT>.  The problem is that, within an
<TT>ENABLED</TT> expression, primed variables are really bound, so this
naive substitution results in variable capture.  The meaning of
formula <TT>F</TT> is really
<PRE>
   \exists $uprime, $vprime : ($uprime = u) /\ ($vprime = v)
</PRE>

To ensure that instantiation preserves validity, we make the following
rule for the <TT>ENABLED</TT> operator:
<UL>
<LI> When instantiating a module, every declared variable symbol that
occurs primed in an <TT>ENABLED</TT> expression is renamed to a new
variable symbol before substituting for the declared symbols.
</UL>
For example, 
<PRE>
   ------------------ MODULE M ------------------
   VARIABLE u
   G(v, A) == ENABLED (A \/ ({u, v}' = {u, v}))
   H == G(u, u' /= u)
   ==============================================
</PRE>

defines <TT>G</TT> to equal
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $v, $A : ENABLED ($A \/ ({u, $v}' = {u, $v}))
</PRE>

and defines <TT>H</TT> to equal
<PRE>
   ENABLED (u' /= u) \/ ({u, u}' = {u, u})
</PRE>

Before instantiating <TT>M</TT>, the definition of
<TT>G</TT> is changed to to
<PRE>
   LAMBDA $v, $A : ENABLED ($A \/ ({$$u, $v}' = {u, $v}))
</PRE>

and the definition of <TT>H</TT> is changed to
<PRE>
   ENABLED ($$u' /= u) \/ ({$$u, $$u}' = {$$u, $$u})
</PRE>

(The two "<TT>$</TT>"s in the name <TT>$$x</TT> are meant to indicate that it
is a new bound variable symbol.)  Note that the substitution for
<TT>u'</TT> in the definition of <TT>G</TT> occurs <I>after</I> that definition
is used in defining <TT>H</TT>.<P>

As another example, consider the module
<PRE>
   ----------------- MODULE MM ------------------
   VARIABLES u, v
   A    ==  (u' = u) /\ (v' /= v)
   B(d) ==  ENABLED d
   C    ==  B(A)
   ==============================================
</PRE>

and the instantiation
<PRE>
   VARIABLE x
   I == INSTANCE MM WITH u &lt;- x, v &lt;- x
</PRE>

This instantiation yields 
<PRE>
   I.A  =  (x' = x) /\ (x' /= x)
   I.B  =  LAMBDA $d : ENABLED $d
   I.C  =  ENABLED (($u' = x) /\ ($v' = x))
</PRE>

Note that <TT>I.C</TT> is not equivalent to <TT>I.B(I.A)</TT>.  In fact,
<TT>I.C</TT> is valid while <TT>I.B(I.A)</TT> is equivalent to <TT>FALSE</TT>.<P>

The other TLA+ primitives that have implicit quantification are
<TT>\cdot</TT> (action composition) and <TT>-+-&gt;</TT> (while).  The rule for
<TT>\cdot</TT> is similar to that for <TT>ENABLED</TT>, where in the
expression <TT>e_1 \cdot e_2</TT>, primed variables in <TT>e_1</TT> and
unprimed variables in <TT>e_2</TT> are bound.  The rule for <TT>-+-&gt;</TT> is
that, before instantiating a module, each instance of <TT>P -+-&gt; Q</TT> is
replaced by an equivalent formula containing explicit quantification.
The precise formula can be found elsewhere.<P>

reduce

to <TT>&lt;&lt;Y+Z, Y+Z&gt;&gt; \in S</TT>--and finally, replace all bound symbols,
including the parameters of the definition (the symbols <TT>n</TT> and
<TT>m</TT> in the definition of <TT>Nbrs</TT>) by "untypable" symbols that
do not already appear in the expression.<P>

which this file is to be found will be system dependent.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note7"><B>Note 7</B></A><DD> If module <TT>Foo</TT> makes local
definitions that clash with definitions in the current module, then
the body of <TT>Foo</TT> cannot be inserted into the current module.  This

body of <TT>Foo</TT> in the current module.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note8"><B>Note 8</B></A><DD> If module <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> had
defined an infix operator <TT>??</TT>, then this statement defines
<TT>Foo.??</TT> to be an infix operator.  The expression <TT>a Foo.?? b</TT>
looks strange, but the alternatives seem worse.  In practice, one does
not define infix operators in modules that one wants to use with this
kind of renaming.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note9"><B>Note 9</B></A><DD> Submodules provide a scoping
mechanism for module names, which in principle could be used to define
the mapping between module names and modules.  For example, the
modules written by user Jones of company XYZ could be submodules of a
module named <TT>Jones</TT>, which is a submodule of a module named
<TT>XYZ</TT>.  However, in practice, such name scoping will be provided by
directory structures and file search paths.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note10"><B>Note 10</B></A><DD> 
Two declarations of a symbol <TT>s</TT> are the same if they both declare
<TT>s</TT> to be a constant or both declare it to be a variable.  Two
definitions are the same if they have parse trees that differ only in
the names of bound variables.  <P>

<DT><A NAME="Note11"><B>Note 11</B></A><DD> In general, we should define
validity of <TT>M</TT> to mean <TT>A |= T</TT>, which means that the validity
of <TT>A</TT> implies the validity of <TT>T</TT>.  If <TT>A</TT> is a constant
formula, then <TT>A |= T</TT> is equivalent to the validity of 
 <TT>A =&gt; T</TT>.  For writing specifications, this special case is all we 
need, and restricting ourselves to it allows us to avoid introducing
the semantic operator <TT>|=</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note12"><B>Note 12</B></A><DD> 
It is tempting to include an instantiated module's assumptions as
theorems, so they become proof obligations of the current module.
However, it may be impossible to discharge those proof obligations
in the current module.  For example, suppose we were specifying a
graph algorithm and we wrote
<PRE>
   VARIABLES N, E
   INSTANTIATE DirectedGraphs WITH Node &lt;- N, Edge &lt;- E
</PRE>

where <TT>N</TT> and <TT>E</TT> represent variables of the algorithm.  The
instantiated assumption of the <TT>DirectedGraphs</TT> module is
 <TT>E \subseteq N \X N</TT>.  
It is impossible to prove this formula because it is not valid; <TT>N</TT>
and <TT>E</TT> are flexible variables, so they can assume any values.
What we do expect to be able to prove is
<PRE>
(*)   Spec =&gt; [](E \subseteq N \X N)
</PRE>

where <TT>Spec</TT> is the TLA formula that specifies the algorithm.
Formally, there is nothing special about <TT>Spec</TT>; it is just one of
many defined symbols.  So, there is no reason to take (*) as the proof
obligation associated with the instantiation.  Moreover, <TT>Spec</TT>
might not even be defined in the current module, but in some other
module that extends the current one.<P>

<DT><A NAME="Note13"><B>Note 13</B></A><DD> For simplicity, we always
consider <TT>Enabled A</TT> to have state level, even in those special
cases when we could determine that it is a constant formula.
