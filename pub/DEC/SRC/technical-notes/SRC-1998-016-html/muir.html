I've just finished the second year of my PhD at the University of
Pennsylvania where my advisor is Jonathan Smith.  My work so far has
been on alternative (i.e. non-SMP), operating system structures for
multiprocessor systems, particularly in the context of
high-performance and active networks. <p>

<h3>Summer Research Project</h3>

This summer I've been working with Sanjay Ghemawat on a static
analyser for Java programs to detect unnecessary synchronisation
operations.  This information is then used by the <tt>srcjava</tt> JVM to
eliminate those redundant operations.<p>

Synchronisation in Java is a relatively expensive operation, typically
requiring about 75 CPU cycles in <tt>srcjava</tt>.  In many cases, Sun's
implementations of the standard Java classes e.g. <tt>StringBuffer</tt> and
</tt>Vector</tt>, are very conservative in their use of synchronisation, thus
imposing overhead on single-threaded programs where the synchronisation 
is not needed.<p>

We designed and implemented a static analyser which would perform a
data-flow analysis on allocated objects to determine whether those
objects ever became exposed outside their creating threads.  If not,
accesses to that object by method invocations would not need to be
synchronised.<p>

Our initial simple and conservative implementation was able to detect
that allocated objects were unexposed only when these objects
were accessed exclusively via local variables. Unfortunately, most 
objects (StringBuffers being the notable
exception) tend not to be used in this manner, except by hardened C
programmers such as myself. Rather, they are accessed 
in a more object-oriented way via fields of other, containing objects.<p>

This observation prompted us to design and begin implementation of a
second analyser which performs a global analysis of allocated
objects, building an exposure dependency graph between objects
e.g. the operation <tt>x.a=y</tt> stores <tt>y</tt> into <tt>x</tt>, so that an edge is added from <tt>x</tt>
to <tt>y</tt>.  We believe this analyser will be able to detect a higher
proportion of unexposed objects than our first implementation.<p>
