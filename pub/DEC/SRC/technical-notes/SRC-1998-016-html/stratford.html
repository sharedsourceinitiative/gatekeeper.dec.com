I am a PhD student at the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory
working with Simon Crosby. I am interested in the general area of
system support for multimedia. My specific interests are in the area
of operating system resource management and for my thesis work I am
looking at the problems that arise when considering the
interdependencies between multiple resources in the usage patterns of
multimedia applications.<P>

I chose SRC for an internship because of the high reputation of its
intern programme, and because Bob Taylor once said that it rains too
much in Seattle.<P>

<h3>SRC Project</h3>

Over the summer I worked on the replication aspects of a
versioned file system that is part of a source code configuration
management suite called Vesta.<P>

The underlying goal of Vesta is that all builds should be
repeatable. This has led to a design where the source code repository
stores packages as combinations of immutable files and
immutable/append only directories.  To enable varying degrees of
cooperation between different repository sites such as collaborative
working or disconnected operation, a global name space is required.<P>

The global namespace is achieved through a concept of "mastership" of 
a source file or directory. The "master" is considered the coordination
site for insertion of new names or content into the system.<P>

Over the summer I have worked on various aspects of the design and
implementation. This has included: <P>

<UL>

<LI>Design and implementation of a protocol for the transfer of 
mastership between two repositories and locating the current master.<P>

<LI>Design and implementation of a manually invoked replication tool that
replicates between two repositories according to a configuration file.
The file has an entry that allows requests such as "replicate everything
that is required to build this package" which works by following
the package imports listed in the package build description.<P>

<LI>Implementation of reverse lookup tables in the repository to 
improve the degree of sharing in the destination repository of 
a replication.<P>

<LI>Design of procedures to allow working with remotely mastered packages.
An example is checking out a remotely mastered package.<P>

<LI>Design of an automatic replication tool that automatically
propagates updates as they happen.<P>

</UL>

Looking back over the summer, I partly regret not spending more time
selecting a suitable project when I first arrived. The project proved
to be interesting but did not really contain enough design work and
focused too heavily on implementation. Much of the design was already
in place when I arrived.<P>

<h3>Other</h3>

SRC is an exciting place to work, with many great people. I have been
particularly impressed by how well the theory and systems people work
togther when solving problems. This is what makes SRC unique.<P>
