I am a PhD student at Stanford University, and I worked on the data transfer
problem this summer with my host Monika Henzinger and my advisor Serge
Plotkin. I would like to thank Monika for a wonderful summer.<p>

The data transfer problem is the following: data transfer requests of the form
<i>(a<sub>j,</sub> p<sub>j,</sub> R<sub>j</sub>)</i> 
arrive in a network, where 

<i>a<sub>j</sub></i> 

is the arrival time of the
request, 

<i>p<sub>j</sub></i> 

the amount of data to be transferred, and 

<i>R<sub>j</sub></i> 

the set of
links on the route over which the data needs to be transferred. Our goal over
the summer was to design centralized scheduling algorithms for this problem.
The scheduler must assign a start time 

<i>s<sub>j</sub></i> 

and a data transfer rate 

<i>r<sub>j</sub></i> 

to
each request. The completion time 

<i>C<sub>j</sub></i> 

of the request is 

<i>s<sub>j</sub> + p<sub>j</sub>/r<sub>j</sub></i>. 

We
analyze the performance of our algorithms using the framework of online
algorithms.<p>

The most intuitive performance measure we considered was the average response
time (or average flow time) where the response time (flow time) of job <i>j</i>

is

<i>C<sub>j</sub> - a<sub>j</sub></i>. 

Notice that this is the number that a user really cares about --
"how long did it take for the job to complete after it arrived?"<p>

We came up with algorithms that give good performance guarantees for measures
that are in some sense easier than average response time. For average response
time, we showed that NO algorithm can guarantee close (i.e better than a
polynomial factor close) to optimum performance against a malicious adversary.
However, we were able to relax the model using "resource augmentation" and
prove interesting results in this model. A writeup should be available from my
web page at some time in the future.<p>

If you have read thus far, you have probably guessed that I work in
Algorithms. I describe my research interests as networking, approximation
algorithms, online algorithms, randomized algorithms, graph algorithms and
various combinations of the above. More specifics are available from 
my <A HREF="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~agoel/research.html">
publications</A> list. One of the results
that I am excited about is on switch scheduling. Check it out.<p>

I was amazed by the diversity of interests at SRC and even more, by the amount
of interaction between people with such diverse interests. My favourite
experience would have to be playing softball during the Intern Salute. I had
never played softball (or baseball) before and it was good fun.<p>
