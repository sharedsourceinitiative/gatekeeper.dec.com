      This page describes a summer project undertaken by Panagiotis
      (Pete) Manolios (UT Austin) while a 1998 intern at SRC.  Pete

    <H2>Overview</H2>
    
    <p>
      <A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/tla/">TLA</A>, the
      Temporal Logic of Actions, is a logic designed for reasoning
      about concurrent and reactive systems.  TLA+ is a language based
      on TLA; it has many syntactic extensions (e.g.  <A
      HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/tla/papers.html#DefinitionsAndModules">modules</A>
      and <A
      HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/tla/papers.html#TLA+Operators">operators</A>)
      that make it a useful and powerful specification language.

      "Model Checking" is a term used to refer to algorithms that
      decide if structures are models of formulae.  In practice, model
      checking algorithms are mostly used to verify that finite state,
      reactive programs satisfy properties written in some temporal
      logic.  Much work has been done in developing efficient and
      practical model checking algorithms.
    </P>
    
    <p>
      TLA+ contains the natural numbers and quantifiers, hence we
      cannot model check arbitrary TLA+ specifications.  We decided to
      focus on finite state systems and invariance properties.  Our
      model checker accepts as input an arbitrary TLA+ spec
      (specification) and a <i>restrictions file</i>.  The
      restrictions file provides "type" information about the state
      variables; this restricts the TLA+ spec so that it is finite
      state.  The restrictions file also contains invariance
      properties to be checked.  The model checker proceeds to check
      that the TLA+ spec, appropriately restricted, satisfies the
      properties.  Our checker is disk-based, that is, it is not
      limited by the size of main memory.  Another notable feature of
      the checker is that it can efficiently convert states to a
      canonical and compact representation.  This representation is
      used for equality checking and for space-efficient disk usage.
    </P>



    <H2>Model Checking</H2> 

    <p> 
      Model checkers, in the worst case, work by exhaustively
      exploring the state space.  Some model checkers are symbolic,
      that is, they use BDD's to represent sets of states, whereas
      others represent sets of states explicitly.  Due to the
      complexity of deciding the next state relation of a TLA+ spec
      and because the main application in mind is a cache coherence
      protocol, we chose to use an explicit representation.  Roughly,
      our model checker starts from the initial state of a spec and
      generates a tree of reachable states (it is a tree because
      duplicate states are ignored) in stages.  At each stage we check
      that the new states satisfy the invariants.  We proceed until
      there are no new states, or until a "bad" state is discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main problems with designing and implementing the model
      checker are: parsing the input, constructing the next state
      relation, checking for equality of states, and making effective
      use of disk.  We will not discuss the parsing or next state
      relation issues.  Equality checking is important because it
      allows us to throw away states already visited and it is
      difficult because the representation of states is not unique.
      For example, a variable in a TLA+ spec can be a set containing
      functions, strings, numbers, and sets.  Finally, model checkers
      tend to run out of memory, hence a disk based approach can be
      very useful.
    </p>

    
    <H2>Canonical and Compact States</H2>

    <p>
      Any (hereditarily) finite set can be specified as a type in the
      restrictions file.  We provide support for enumerated types,
      intervals (of integers), functions, subsets, subsets with size
      restrictions (for example, all subsets of a set which have less
      that eleven elements), sequences, tuples, and records.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main idea for converting a variable (or state) into a space
      efficient representation is that a tuple of numbers in mixed
      radix notation can be converted to a number and back.  We place
      the elements of an enumerated type into a bijection with an
      initial segment of the naturals.  For more complicated types, we
      can use the already constructed bijections of the "component
      types" to build the appropriate bijection--e.g., a
      function is a sequence of numbers, representing elements in the
      co-domain; the length of the sequence is the size of the domain.
      This sequence can be converted to a single number, as mentioned
      above.  Proceeding in this fashion, we can think of the state as
      a single number.  We show that the number of bits required to
      represent a state is minimal in the following sense: it is the
      ceiling of the log of the size of the state space (which is the
      product of the sizes of the types of the state variables).
    </p>

    <H2>Using Disk</H2>
    
    <p> 
      As mentioned previously, the main limitation of most model
      checkers is main memory.  A disk based approach will work only
      if the disk is accessed in a disciplined way such
	as follows: Essentially, we use three
      files: <tt>old</tt>, <tt>new</tt>, and <tt>next</tt> and proceed
      in rounds.  At the beginning of a round, <tt>old</tt> and
      <tt>new</tt> are sorted and disjoint; <tt>next</tt> is empty.
      The set of successors of the states in <tt>new</tt> is generated
      and placed into <tt>next</tt>, which is then sorted.
      <tt>old</tt> and <tt>new</tt> are merged (to produce next
      round's <tt>old</tt>) and used to filter the states in
      <tt>next</tt>; the filtered states become the next round's
      <tt>new</tt>.
    </p>

    <H2>Some Experimental results</H2>
    
    <p> 
      Preliminary experiments show that the overhead for placing
      states into canonical representations is between 10%-25%.  The
      resulting space savings can be drastic, e.g., the
      alternating bit protocol required 750 bytes per state to be
      represented, using Java's serialize. The canonical state
      required only 5 bytes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preliminary experiments also show that using the disk adds about
      50% overhead.  Although not mentioned above, various caches and
      data structures have been used to reduce disk usage.
    </p>

    <P> 
      The model checker was used to verify various versions of the
      alternating bit protocol.  The tested versions of the alternating bit
      protocol have about 64M states.
    </P>

    <H2>Conclusions, Future Work</H2>
    <p>
      The project has reached a point where it would be a good idea to
      try verifying more examples in an effort to streamline the model
      checking process.  When the system is stable we can try a really
      huge example, namely the cache coherence protocol.  This may
      require many disks and a few weeks (months?), but I expect it
      will be worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some possible enhancements are: adding error reporting
      capabilities (if an invariant fails, we should
      print a sequence of actions that lead to a bad state); allowing
      various search strategies; multi-threaded/distributed
      implementations; allowing various modes of operation
      (How much hashing? Do we record parent information?); and, using
      even more compact representations (storing offsets
      instead of numbers).
    </p>

    <p>
      It will be a good idea to encourage engineers to use the tool.  I
      expect unintended applications may result, one of which may
be to use the model checker to find out how to put a system in a
      certain state. One might accomplish this by trying to prove that 
the system can never get
      into the state and by waiting for the model checker to produce a
      counterexample.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another idea is to extend the model checker so that it can check
      arbitrary temporal TLA+ properties.  This will require storing
      the entire transition graph (as opposed to a spanning tree,
      which is what is currently done) of the system.  It has been
      shown that model checking arbitrary TLA+ properties (on finite
      structures) is an NP-complete problem.
