This is a brief report on the work performed by Silvija Seres during
her summer research internship at SRC in 1999, together with her host,
Greg Nelson.  The main theme of the work was evaluating two tools
developed at SRC for checking the correctness of multi-threaded Java
programs: Eraser, a dynamic race detector, first described at SOSP in
1997 [<a href="#eraser">1</a>], and ESC/Java [<a href="#extended">2</a>], 
a verification-based static program
checker.  There are two main research results: porting Eraser to work
on Java programs, and applying ESC/Java (for the first time) to a
sizable multi-threaded program.  As a source of test cases we used the
Mercator [<a href="#mercator">3</a>] Web crawler by Allan Heydon and 
Marc Najork.<P>

Our goal was not to build tools but to evaluate them.  Nevertheless,
some tool-building was inevitable.  To achieve the necessary
expressibility with ESC/Java, we needed to add one new pragma and some
flexibility for the use of so-called ghost variables. With the help of
Sanjay Ghemawat, we implemented Eraser for Java.  The Eraser algorithm
finds races by checking all loads and stores to detect shared
variables that are accessed by different threads without using a lock
to ensure mutual exclusion.<P>

While checking Mercator, we identified six basic concurrency control
techniques:<P>

<OL>

<li>In the "monitored object" technique, the methods of a class provide
internal synchronization before accessing shared variables.<P>

<li>In the "client locking" technique, this synchronization is the
responsibility of the client of the shared class.<P>

<li>In the "per-thread object" technique, no particular instance of the
shared class is accessed by more than one thread.<P>

<li>In the "read-only data" technique, thread-safety is achieved by making
the data immutable after initialization.<P>

<li>In the "exclusive/shared" technique, the program uses exclusive/shared
locks, also called reader/writer locks, which are a well-known kind of
lock that can be held by a thread either in exclusive mode or in
shared mode.<P>

<li>In the "temporal separation" technique, conflicting accesses are
guaranteed to be non-concurrent because the computation imposes an
order on them.  There are many examples, of which the most typical is
a pipeline in which the shared data is accessible to one thread per
stage.<P>

</ol>

We have also found places in Mercator where these techniques are used
in combination.<P>

ESC Java's annotation language was designed to specify the monitored
object technique, but all the others represent specification
challenges.  Eraser deals with the first four techniques
automatically, and the rest require minimal annotations.  We have
designed annotation strategies to allow ESC/Java checking of all the
techniques. Our strategies make heavy use of ghost variables and of
the ESC/Java annotations "defined_if" and "writable_if" (the latter of
which we had to add in the course of our research).<P>

We haven't annotated all of Mercator for ESC/Java, so all of the races
that we found were found with Eraser.  Mercator consists of
approximately 25,000 lines of code, and Eraser produced fifteen
warnings on the first run.  Of these warnings, two were real races and
the rest were false alarms.  The two races were fixed, and sixteen
lines of Eraser annotations were added to supress the false alarms.<P>

We have also checked Pachyderm [<a href="#pachyderm">4</a>], the 
Java mail and news system built by
Andrew Birrell et. al.  There were a large number of warnings,
primarily because Pachyderm uses the Java windowing classes, which
seem to be a fulsome source of races.  Andrew claimed that three of
the warnings were worth acting on in his code.<P>

Our first conclusion is that Mercator uses more synchronization
techniques than were envisioned by the designers of ESC/Java.<P>

Our second conclusion is that Eraser is more effective than ESC at
finding race conditions, especially given a large, unannotated
program.<P>

Third, ESC/Java requires far more annotation work. A result of this, however,
is that it allows for the documentation of the synchronization design of the
program.<P>

We have not experienced coverage to be a problem with either tool, but
it seems still to be an open issue for each tool, for different
reasons.  In Eraser we don't have a clear coverage measure, because in
addition to passing through each branch of the program at least once,
one needs to check that each shared variable has been accessed by at least
two threads.<P>
