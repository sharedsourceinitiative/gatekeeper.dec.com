<h2>Introduction</h2>

This year will be my fourth as a PhD student in computer science at
the University of Washington.  My advisor is Craig Chambers, and my
research involves the study of object-oriented programming languages
that support multimethods.  In particular, I have designed modular
static typechecking algorithms for such languages.<p>

I chose to do an internship at SRC for several reasons.  I have been
interested in formal methods for many years, so I was happy for the
opportunity to learn about the challenges and tradeoffs involved in
creating a practical program verification tool.  I also knew a bit
about SRC and thought that it would be a fun and exciting work
environment.  Finally, I was interested in taking a break from my PhD
research and getting a glimpse of life outside academia.<p>


<h2>Extended Static Checking</h2>

The Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java) is a tool designed to
catch common programming errors at compile-time.  A programmer writes
an ordinary Java program but adds annotations, such as pre- and
postconditions on methods.  Each annotated method is translated into a
logical formula which is valid if and only if the method meets its
specification.  A theorem prover searches for counter-examples to the
logical formula, which correspond to possible errors in the original
Java method.  A key design principle of ESC/Java is modular checking,
which means that each method is checked in isolation, given only the
specifications, and not the implementations, of other methods in the
program.<P>


<h2>More Informative Warning Messages</h2>

Reducing program checking to theorem proving allows ESC/Java to check
a wide variety of program properties and to leverage existing theorem
proving technology.  However, this architecture makes error reporting
challenging.  In particular, it is difficult to turn counter-examples
from the theorem prover into useful user-level messages about the
original Java method.<P>

Previously, ESC/Java was able to deduce from a counter-example which
ESC/Java annotation had failed to verify.  For example, if a method's
postcondition is potentially violated, ESC/Java reports this
information to the programmer.  My summer project consisted in
extending this "report warning" in a way that would
generate more specific (and useful) information.  We were most
successful in targeting specific programming situations that ESC/Java
users have found hard to understand.  <p>

Our work took the following direction: Since methods often have
numerous possible execution paths, depending on the choice made at
each branching point, we implemented a way to extract--from the
counter-example--a complete trace of the particular execution path
through the method that caused the warning to occur.<P>

We then targeted two specific kinds of ESC/Java warnings that can be
hard to understand:<P>  

The first--a common warning--occurs when a class 
has a particular kind of sharing constraint 
on one of its fields, where the sharing constraint is insufficiently annotated.   
For this we devised ESC/Java support for specifying this constraint 
and for understanding when an implicit constraint of this kind is 
potentially violated.<P>

The second involved providing support for suggesting annotations to remove
spurious warnings related to Java's covariant subtype rule for arrays.  
In particular, <i>S[]</i> is treated in Java as a subtype of <i>T[]</i> 
when <i>S</i> is a
subtype of <i>T</i>.  The use of this rule is not always provably safe at
compile-time.  Therefore, Java enforces a run-time safety check on 
arrays.  Because of this potential lack of compile-time safety, ESC/Java
issues warnings unless there are sufficient annotations to allow
arrays to be verified statically.<P>


<h2>Reducing the ESC/Java Annotation Burden</h2>

For the last few weeks of my internship, I worked on a completely
different problem--trying to reduce the annotation burden on
programmers.  If ESC/Java is run on an unannotated program, many
spurious warnings will result (for example, a pointer dereference
will cause a null dereference warning to be issued).  Our observation
is that spurious warnings can be reduced by checking a method using
some context from its callers and callees, rather than performing
completely modular checking.  To this end, we implemented an
infrastructure in ESC/Java to allow method calls to be inlined and
checked by ESC/Java in several different ways.  We have just begun
designing experiments that make use of this new infrastructure.<P>
