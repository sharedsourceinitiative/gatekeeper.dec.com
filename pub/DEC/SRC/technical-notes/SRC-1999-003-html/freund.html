<h2>Introduction</h2>

A race may occur in a concurrent program when two threads access a 
shared memory location at the same time.  This situation often 
causes unintended behavior ranging from memory corruption to execution 
failure.  Since the effect of a race depends upon the interleaving of 
program execution, races may be difficult to locate and fix, even 
after their effects have been observed.<P>

To avoid race conditions, programmers often adopt a 
programming discipline in which shared resources are guarded by 
locks.  Before accessing any shared structure, the necessary lock 
must be acquired.  This discipline ensures that no two threads ever 
access the same resource at the same time.  Using locks 
in this fashion shifts the problem of preventing races to one of enforcing 
the locking discipline. <P> 

This project summary describes a static analysis 
technique that supports this locking discipline in concurrent Java 
programs. The analysis technique, which is presented in the form 
of the static type system, was designed so that it has the following 
desirable features: <P>

<ol>
<li>a sound formal foundation
<li>low programmer overhead
<li>the ability to check a reasonable set of programming idioms
</ol>

The following section describes an extension to the Java type system 
that captures locking information; the third section describes a prototype 
implementation, and the fourth section summarizes our experiences with it.<P>

<h2>Type System and Annotation Language</h2>

The project's starting point was to work from a race-free type system for 
a concurrent object calculus [Flanagan and Abadi 1999]
[<a href="#object">2</a>]. The most  
important features associated with the adaptation of this type system to Java 
are presented in the following examples.  To preserve compatibility 
with the standard Java compilers, the additional type information 
used in our analysis is written in special comments in the code, 
similar to those of <i>escjava</i> [Leino et al. 1999]
[<a href="#checking">4</a>].  
These annotations 
are comments that begin with the character '#'. The following class 
is a monitored counter:<P>

<pre>

class Counter {
    private int c = 0 /*# guarded_by this */;
    private void set(int x) /*# requires this */ {
	c = x;
    }
    public  void increment() {
	synchronized(this) {
	    set(c+1);
	}
    }
}

</pre>

The <i>guarded_by</i> annotation on the field <i>c</i> indicates which lock must 
be held to access that field, and the <i>requires</i> clause on the set 
method indicates which lock (or locks) must be held prior to invoking 
that method.  To typecheck a program, a conservative approximation 
of the set of locks held at each program point is determined, and 
the checker then verifies whether the constraints expressed in the 
annotations are satisfied on each field access and method invocation. <P> 

As part of this verification process, the analysis needs to determine 
whether a specific lock is in the lock set. The set membership test 
requires some notion of equality between lock names, but since our 
analysis cannot rely on run-time values, we approximate run-time value 
equivalence with syntactic equality. <P>

Another common programming idiom is to create unsynchronized 
classes and require the client to provide the necessary synchronization.  
This type of class may be expressed in our type system using classes 
parameterized by lock names.  The following code example shows how to 
write a counter monitored by a lock in the client code:<P>

<pre>

class Counter/*# {ghost Object o} */ {
    private int value = 0  /*# guarded_by o */;
    private void set(int x) /*# requires o */ {
        value = x;
    }
    public void increment() /*# requires o */ {
        set(value+1);
    }
}

Object mutex = new Object();
Counter/*#{mutex}*/ c = new Counter/*#{mutex}*/();

</pre>

It is often the case that a significant fraction of a concurrent 
program does not use synchronization at all. To avoid the need to 
require locks on objects that are not shared between threads, we 
introduce the notion of a <i>thread_local</i> class into the type system. 
A <i>thread_local</i> class is a class whose instances are never shared 
between threads, indicated with the annotation <i>thread_local</i> on the 
class declaration.  This type of class requires no synchronization 
on field accesses, and a class may be thread local only if:<P>

<ol>

<li>no instances of the class are stored in fields of a shared class
<li>the class is not a subclass of <i>java.lang.Thread</i>

</ol>

The first requirement is checked with a simple escape analysis.  
For technical reasons, programs using <i>thread_local</i> classes are 
assumed to have additional run-time checks on down casts.  One 
final feature added to the type system is an escape mechanism to 
circumvent the analysis when it is too restrictive.  As usual, it 
is the programmer's responsibility to ensure the validity of each 
use of these escapes.<P>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<i>Rccjava</i>, a prototype type checker, was implemented as an 
extension to an existing Java front-end.  The main additions to 
the standard Java type checker were the algorithm to compute lock 
sets, the notion of syntactic equality, and classes parameterized by 
lock names.  Several annotation inference techniques were also 
incorporated into the implementation in order to reduce the number of 
annotations required for large programs.  These inference
techniques include analysis to 
determine whether an unannotated class is <i>thread_local</i> or <i>thread_shared</i>, 
and also include the assumption that unannotated fields of shared classes are 
guarded by the lock of the self object.<P>

<h2>Experimental Results</h2>

The prototype implementation was used to check race conditions in 
a number of programs.  Four representative examples are:<P>

<ol>
<li>the <i>java.util.Hashtable</i> class
<li>the <i>java.util.Vector</i> class
<li>Ambit, an implementation of mobile agents [<a href="#mobile">1</a>]
<li>WebL, an interpreter for WebL programs [<a href="#webl">3</a>]
</ol>

The following chart summarizes the number of annotations required 
by <i>rccjava</i>:<P>

<pre>

Program          Size (lines)   Number of annotations   User time (hours)	

Hashtable              434                46                    1	
Vector                 440                15                  0.5	
Ambit	               4,500              37                    3	
WebL	              20,000             421                   16	

</pre>

The large number of annotations in Hashtable may be attributed to the 
use of type parameters which require an annotation on each reference 
to a parameterized type name.  The two larger examples required 
approximately 20 annotations per thousand lines of code.  One race 
was found in the Vector class, and several races were found in the 
WebL code.<P>

<h2>Conclusions and Further Work</h2>

The initial experiments with <i>rccjava</i> indicate that it is a useful 
tool for detecting races.  While more difficult to use than dynamic 
tools like Eraser [Savage et al. 1997]
[<a href="#eraser">5</a>], it is not subject to the same 
coverage problems as those tools.  In addition, the annotation overhead 
is lower than some other static analysis techniques, such as using <i>escjava</i>.  
However, that tool captures a much broader range of program properties 
and has not been tuned specifically to race detection.<P>

The most important direction for future work is to reduce the annotation 
requirements.  We are currently exploring better annotation inference 
algorithms and the possibility of using feedback from dynamic tools 
to help infer annotations.  There are also additional features to implement, 
such as reader-writer locks and parameterized methods.<P>
