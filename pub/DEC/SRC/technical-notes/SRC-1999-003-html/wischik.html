This report describes a summer project undertaken by Lucian Wischik of
the University of Cambridge, at Compaq Systems Research Center. He was
supervised by Leslie Lamport and Yuan Yu.

<h2>The Temporal Logic of Actions</h2>

<p>"Engineers should be able to specify and verify their systems directly
and conveniently in logic." This comment offers a pragmatic
motivation for using Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA), and its
associated model-checker (TLC). The comment also implies a distinction
between TLC and other comparable model-checkers, where specifications must be translated
into a special-purpose language. (A model of a specified system, in
this context, is a sample execution trace. To 'check' a model is to
ensure that it satisfies the given verification conditions).

<p>The goal of the project was to extend TLC to verify arbitrary
temporal formulas. Hitherto, it could verify only "always" formulas
about states:
<pre>   "always, the state will be such with no dangling pointers"</pre>
Now it can verify more general formulas:
<pre>   "if ever I put a datum into my reliable-transport-protocol,
   then it must eventually come out the other end."</pre>

<p>The problem of verifying arbitrary temporal formulas about states is a standard
one, addressed by other model-checkers as well.  It is solved using
the "tableau" technique of Clark and Emerson [1981]. We briefly
outline this technique below. (Temporal formulas are ones involving
the predicates <tt>[]</tt> always, or <tt><></tt> eventually. For
instance, <tt>[](a => <>b)</tt> means that every occurence of <tt>a</tt> must
eventually be followed by an occurence of <tt>b</tt>).

<p>However, the application of this technique raises new problems for
the Temporal Logic of Actions. In fact, they arise as a direct
consequence of the very <i>actions</i> that give the logic its
name. (Actions relate the next state of the system to the current state and
describe the transitions of the system. An example action is:
<tt>x'=x+1</tt>.)

<h2>Checking fairness: disjunctive normal forms</h2>

<p>The first problem concerns <i>fairness</i> criteria. A fair
transition is one that must eventually be taken (assuming that it is
possible). In conventional model-checkers, fairness is specified
explicitly in the special-purpose specification language. For example,
to say that the scheduler must eventually allow the process to
proceed, we might write:
<pre>   fair; x := x+1;</pre>
In TLC, fairness is expressed as a logical predicate on
actions, i.e., "Always, eventually, <tt>x'=x+1</tt>"
<pre>   [] <> (x'=x+1)</pre>
Note that this is merely a logic formula, and can appear anywhere in the
specification or verification conditions (whereas the keyword
<tt>fair</tt> can obviously appear only as part of the specification
program).

<p>The new technique we introduced to deal with such formulas, in
specification or verification conditions, involves converting the problem
into <i>disjunctive normal forms</i>. These forms always have the same
structure:
<pre>      (<>[]ea1 /\ []<>ae1 /\ misc1)
   \/ (<>[]ea2 /\ []<>ea2 /\ misc2)
   \/ ...</pre>
Observe that, within each disjunct, the fairness formulas
<tt><>[]</tt> and <tt>[]<></tt> are all gathered together. This gives
them a straightforward decision procedure: an infinite cycle in
the system's behaviour
satisfies <tt><>[]p</tt> if <tt>p</tt> is true <i>everywhere</i> in
the cycle; and it satisfies <tt>[]<>q</tt> if <tt>q</tt> is true
<i>somewhere</i> in the cycle. We provided an algorithm to convert
arbitrary expressions into normal form, proved that the conversion
preserved meaning and that the normal forms were unique, and
implemented the decision procedure.

<h2>Checking arbitrary temporal formulas: the tableau</h2>

<p>The fairness formulas above are a generalisation of the fairness
specifications present in other model-checkers. But the Temporal Logic
of Actions actually allows even greater generality -- it allows
arbitrary temporal formulas involving actions and states. To handle
such formulas in full generality requires that the standard tableau
technique be modified to handle actions. Unfortunately, a
way to implement this modification was not discovered until 
late in the summer, so there
was insufficient time to fully develop the theory. (The disjunctive normal
forms, although just a special case, are still important: they are
essentially an optimisation that reduces the exponential cost of the
fairness tableau).


<p>The tableau technique is as follows: To check whether a sample
execution trace satisfies a given temporal formula on states -- for
instance, <tt>Not ([] (a => <>b))</tt> -- we construct a particular
(non-deterministic) finite state machine. This machine accepts only
those traces which satisfy the formula. We run the sample
execution-trace in parallel with the machine. If the trace is accepted
by the machine, then it satisfies the temporal formula! The machine
and example formula is illustrated below:

<p>The suggested modification of the technique, so that it can check
arbitrary formulas on actions as well as on states, is illustrated in
the example machine below:

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The techniques described above--for converting the problem of fairness
criteria into disjunctive normal forms, and for the tableau technique for
checking arbitrary temporal formulas--were implemented within
TLC. As presented, the techniques may be prohibitively expensive in
time and space. They have not yet been tested on real-world
examples. It remains an open question as to whether there is any
practical, engineering benefit to the verification of
temporal formulas. Hopefully, the two new techniques introduced in
this summer project will eventually lead to an answer.
