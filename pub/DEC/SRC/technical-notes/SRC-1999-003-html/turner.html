I am working towards a PhD at The Queen's University of Belfast and 
collaborated with Stefan Ludwig and Bob McNamara on a board called the 
Directional Array Microphone (DAM). <P>

Bob McNamara was looking into microphone arrays and thought they were 
interesting things to investigate. So a piece of general-purpose data 
capture and delivery hardware was designed and built. This summer I wrote
the firmware of the FPGA, implemented some tools to interact 
with the DAM board, and did some fun DSP stuff with the microphone array. <P>

The DAM board is made up of eight Analog to Digital Converters and a connector 
for daughter boards. There can be a maximum combination of 40 inputs and/or 
outputs per DAM board (where the daughter boards supply the extra inputs 
and outputs). If 40 microphones are not sufficient for the task, multiple boards can be 
synchronized to build larger systems and two Ethernet physical layer chips 
are supplied to do this. The board has an EPROM for configuration data 
for the FPGA (firmware). The firmware is used to combine the different 
parts of the board and daughter boards together.<P>

I spent most of the summer working on the firmware. It generates the control 
signals for the ADs while the data returned from the ADs is assembled 
together into packets. As there is no Ethernet controller on the board, 
the firmware has to place the protocol information at either end of the 
packet and send it to the Ethernet link. It also receives packets which 
can be used for the reprogramming of the EPROM. The DAM uses one of the 
100 Mbps Ethernet links to transport data to and from a PC while the software 
on the PC is used for digital signal processing.<P>

What interesting things, then, can be accomplished using an array of microphones? 
Two areas, in particular, appeared worthy of research: high-quality 
speech acquisition and the location of sound sources.<P>

Speech recognition software requires high-quality speech with low background 
noise and little change in the quality of the signal. A straighforward solution 
would be to use a head microphone. As the microphone is close to the source 
of sound, the signal from the microphone will mostly contain the required 
speech with little background noise. However, if we place the microphone 
a more convenient location further away, more background noise will be 
introduced into the signal. Now, if we use more 
than one microphone, "beamforming" can be performed. What this means 
is that we adjust the gain of sound depending on the direction of arrival. 
So in the direction of the sound we want to capture, we can have a large gain, while 
we opt for a low gain from the rest of the arrival directions. As a result, 
we implemented a simple delay & sum beamformer.<P>

The other task we accomplished with the microphone array was to track the sound 
source. Once we calculate the time difference of the sound arrivals between two 
microphones, we can work out the direction of the 
sound through triangulation measurements. This information is then fed back into the 
beamformer. To demonstrate this, we wired up the microphones in SRC's forum 
and showed how the system figured out the position of the speaker.<P>
