VS/QUERY (QMF)</H2>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> So we've got about another decade and a half to go. We're
in the middle of 1980 or so. We're going to finish up the VS/QUERY, and then
John Nauman's going to take over the DB2 era. Bob? VS/QUERY<A NAME="Index323"></A><A NAME="Index324"></A>.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> Thanks, Pat. After Plan B became Plan A, I was asked to take
a new job to manage VS/QUERY and languages at Santa Teresa<A NAME="Index325"></A>.
Maybe you can't be the outcast - the person in charge of the outplan - and then
when they decide you were right, they can't leave you in charge anymore, it's
too embarrassing. So I got asked to manage VS/QUERY, which was a project in
deep trouble. VS/QUERY was the product that the Marketing Division had said for
the last four or five years, "You know, we don't really understand all the
things you people out in Santa Teresa are doing, but we want that one. Give us
that one." And somehow the VS/QUERY group had managed, year after year, not to
be able to deliver a product. And they were kind of caught in a bit of a trap:
they would go meet with Mosh&eacute; and other people back in Yorktown, and
decide that QBE was wonderful and they needed to have all the QBE function that
could be defined working in release one. And then because they knew SQL was
important, they needed to have SQL in there, and they had a few other things in
there as well. So they had about forty people, and a mountain of work to get
done, and a belief that they had to get it all done for release one. So they
would always have reasons - I think at one point, Pat was saying to me during
the break - they had a list of problems with System R. You know, here's the
reasons we can't get this done; System R has these problems, etc., etc. And
when this group started reporting to me, I would ask questions like, "Well, so
what happens when you go meet with the people in System R?" "Oh, we don't do
that." So they had problems, but they weren't resolving the problems.<p>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> I think one of them was that every time there would be a
disk error, it would stop and say, "YSYSTERR".<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> We had seventeen hundred calls to SYSTERR. It was a big
barrier.<p>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> We put Bruce Lindsay<A NAME="Index326"></A>
on this problem and he went and he counted them and changed them to some other
error code.<i> [laughter]</i><p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> And they didn't tell Larry Ellison.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> They all called one routine, called PANIC, and then that
routine called ...<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> I'd say there was a sort of a syndrome that was not unlike
all the people with the different data models. And I hope I don't sound cynical
here, but I'd say that a lot of people got into a syndrome that it was OK not
to make progress as long as you had a reason. And of course there were always
lots of reasons, so not much progress was made. I'd say that folks on VS/QUERY
felt trapped by the fact that they thought they had committed all these things
to Marketing, and that Marketing had told them they had to have all these QBE
functions, and so on, or they wouldn't "have a product." Finally, after lots of
debate about this, and going to lots of meetings about what in QBE couldn't be
translated through SQL, and therefore what functions would be missing that
Marketing said they had to have, I was frankly confused by this, didn't really
understand it. So I finally asked for a list of the ten things that wouldn't be
available in release one, because they couldn't be translated through SQL. I
then went and met with Marketing, and found out they didn't understand what
those things were, either, therefore certainly couldn't demand that they be
there. And we managed frankly to scope the thing down to the point where we
could get a product out the door. Since I left IBM I don't know exactly how
that product has done, but at least when it was released it was a pretty
successful product.<p>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> It's a big money-maker.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> So they had all the right ingredients for a good product:
System R, some ideas from QBE, and perhaps from other things ...<p>
<b>Roger Miller:</b> Bob, QMF is tremendously successful. We had a huge cost
base, so we had to have a high price. Customers bought it, so it became very
profitable.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> Who says cost-plus pricing isn't the right way? I guess we
had a lot of trials and tribulations over the years with the VS/QUERY group
from a System R point of view. Frankly, I think those got ended pretty quickly
and they wound up with a successful product.<p>
<b>C. Mohan:</b> So this is different from QMF?<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> No, VS/QUERY was the code name; sorry: QMF.<p>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> And then we went on to DB2.<p>
<b>Bob Yost:</b> Didn't you actually run that on a bastardized version of
System R? For a long while, there was no DB2 to run on. You basically took some
code, made it work over in your environment so that you could actually test the
query stuff.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> Right. I can't remember whether they shipped QMF with that
black box old version of System R.<p>
<b>Bob Yost:</b> That was just for testing purposes because the underlying
system didn't exist at that point.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> So we're going to have John tell us about DB2? Good.
