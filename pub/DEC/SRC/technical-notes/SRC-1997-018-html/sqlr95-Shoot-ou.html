Shoot-out at the OK Corral</H2>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> The part I didn't understand is, there was something called
QBE that came out?<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Oh, that's a whole other story. We have a whole session
for query.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> No, it's before this.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> OK, let's go to that; that's a good point, you're right.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> There was QBE, and then VS/QUERY and the shoot-out at the OK
Corral<A NAME="Index299"></A>;
all predates this ...<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> OK, let's do that. Brad, can you do QBE<A NAME="Index300"></A><A NAME="Index301"></A>?<p>
<b>Brad Wade:</b> I'm going to have to have quite considerable bit of help on
this, because in time-honored tradition of IBM, we had the System R group
working on relational database systems at San Jose, and we had Mosh&eacute; Zloof<A NAME="Index302"></A>
working on Query by Example<a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[57]</a> - another
relational database system - at Yorktown<A NAME="Index303"></A>.
So a question arose as to why do we have two groups in IBM on opposite coasts
who are doing exactly the same thing. And exactly where Mosh&eacute; and his
group came from, how they got started, I know not. <p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Actually, I know the answer to that, and I'll talk about
it only because it's interesting. There was a group in Yorktown<A NAME="Index304"></A>
that was working on something called Programming by Example.<a name="fnB54"
href="#fn54">[58]</a> Their idea was that somehow you could do business data
processing, like payroll, by giving an example of what you wanted, right, it
was sort of like the output back. If you just showed a fancy piece of software
what you wanted as the output, it would figure out how to get it.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> The RPG model.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> So it was, "Show me what you want as the output, and I'll
figure out how to get it to you from the data that I know is available." That
never came to anything. Actually, do you know what programming by example is?
It really actually happened; it's VisiCalc. That's the closest thing you have
to programming by example, and it's very close, it really is what they were
thinking about. But they never got that, they never got VisiCalc. But they got
something kind of like it, which was Query By Example. So not programming by
example, but at least query by example. And the idea was you could draw a
picture of the answer, and say, "This is the answer I want" and then it would
actually figure out how to get that and give you the answer. So that was Query
By Example; Mosh&eacute; Zloof was the key guy, and Peter de Jong<A NAME="Index305"></A>
was the manager.<p>
<b>Brad Wade:</b> And so, Query By Example was an early graphical interface, if
you will, because it would draw a picture of the table on your screen, and if
you wanted "Salary = 10000," you would write "10000" in the Salary column. And
I guess if you wanted people with Salary greater than 10000, you'd write
"&gt;10000" in the Salary column. In place of SQL's SELECT clause, you'd write
a "P." in the columns that you wanted the query to emit. I can vaguely remember
playing the Query Game<A NAME="Index306"></A>
with some of Mosh&eacute;'s stuff, but my reaction is that simple things in
Query by Example were simple, and complicated things were impossible; at least
they were possible in SQL.<p>
But anyway, in the time-honored tradition of IBM, we had two groups doing the
same thing. The performance issue also raised its head. The shoot-out at the OK
Corral comes from a direct head-to-head performance comparison.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> Brad, I think that before this, somebody from the field fell
in love with QBE, and they were actually shipping it.<p>
<b>Jim Mehl:</b> As an RPQ or something.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> And there were people in the field, and they loved it. They
had stories of tape librarians who'd automated their tape library with it, and
Gene Trivett<A NAME="Index307"></A>
was going around and fixing some of the performance problems, and it was
popping up all over the planet. So it had a very loyal following. It was
obvious to everybody that this did something wonderful. That this was an
end-user program. So then the question became, "So why don't we cancel System
R?" or "Why don't we grow this thing?" I think Bob [Jolls] must have been
confronted with this question a lot.<p>
<b>Bob Jolls:</b> The VS/QUERY group was constantly trying to get the best of
both SQL and QBE, and so that came later. But certainly when I managed that
group, we had to settle all that. But I never was involved in anything where
people looked at QBE as a production replacement for SQL.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> So what was the purpose of the shoot-out?<p>
<b>Pat Selinger:</b> I think it was driven by research management.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> I'll tell you what the shoot-out was. It was a very
unpleasant and interesting confrontation. Gomory<A NAME="Index308"></A>
was worried about the fact that he was investing heavily in two projects that
seemed to be doing roughly the same thing. One of our arguments was that we had
all these smart people like Franco and Jim that had built the RSS, and the RSS
was really good stuff, really good code, I mean it's in SQL/DS even today; the
same code.<p>
<b>C. Mohan:</b> Around when was this?<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> I don't have the exact date, but around 1978, right? When
did the actual shoot-out occur? 1978? Gomory asked Dick Case<A NAME="Index309"></A>
to do a review of the work. Dick Case included Ashok Chandra<A NAME="Index310"></A>,
who currently runs the Computer Science Department - he's the latest version of
Frank King - and one other person, who were all disinterested people, but were
technically capable. They went to Yorktown and learned all about QBE, and then
they came to San Jose to learn all about System R, and I gave them my long
lecture about how the lock manager works and how Compare-and-Swap<A NAME="Index311"></A>
could do locking, and we did it all right, and we knew how to do
Compare-and-Swap-Double. Dick Case was really impressed, because he's probably
the architect of Compare-and-Swap. Ashok was there, and there was this whole
issue of whether you could do QBE on SQL. So that was a different approach,
that was, if you will, our approach, which we wanted VS/QUERY to adopt, which
was that you wouldn't write QBE on the RSS. That's multiple personalities. We
wanted QBE as a graphical interface, emphasizing its strengths - the graphical
stuff - and de-emphasizing its weaknesses, which are XRM<A NAME="Index312"></A>,
no multi-user, poor storage management, and poor performance. Because they were
not a compiler, they were an interpreter only. So Irv Traiger<A NAME="Index313"></A>
did an enormous amount of work, three months work, to show detail-by-detail how
you could map QBE to SQL. There was a controversy about whether the language
QBE was actually well-specified. There was an ambiguity in it and I have notes
from a meeting in which Peter de Jong said, "Well I can't prove you wrong but
I'm sure you're wrong. I don't accept your claim that we're ambiguous, even
though you've documented it eight ways to hell that it was ambiguous." Anyway,
you showed that it could all be done. And so these guys were out there to
evaluate it, and one of the issues was performance, because our claim was you
would want to do it that way among other reasons because you'd get far better
performance. The people back east said, "No, that's not right because it is
<i>ad hoc</i> query and interpretation's fine for <i>ad hoc</i> query." They
wanted to program directly to the RSS.<p>
<b>Brad Wade:</b> Thank you, Mike. My recollections don't go anywhere near as
deep. I do remember it came down to performance. We had System R running on one
of the 3270's in the terminal room. We installed QBE on another user-id, and
had it loaded up on another terminal there in the terminal room. We primed it;
we typed in a SQL query to do something or other; I don't even remember what.
We set up the QBE thing to do the same query, and, sophisticated processes of
the era, we pressed the ENTER keys at the same time and held our stop-watches
up to it to see which would come back first. I even forget whether it was
thirty seconds, or a minute and thirty seconds - System R was back with the
answer, so we looked over at the other terminal and - it's crashed. System R's
star ascended fairly nicely after that.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> We let them make up some of the queries, because they had
come ...<p>
<b>Bruce Lindsay:</b> You mean they didn't finish any queries?<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> No, they did. There was a big performance difference. Even
though we were compiling <i>ad hoc</i> queries ...<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> The most striking performance difference was that Brad could
type, and I forget who the person for QBE was, but he typed with two fingers
and lots of mistakes.<i> [laughter]</i> So when they'd say, "Next query," Brad
would go "Whirrr."<i> [laughter]</i><p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Well, anyway, it turned out to be a dramatic performance
difference, and you could hear the cheers in your brain, even if you couldn't
hear them with your ears. Everybody was very elated, because the performance
difference was so dramatic, even on the queries that de Jong had given to Ashok
and Case to give, because he was hoping those were our weak underbelly, even on
those we were dramatically faster, like a factor of ten I think in some
cases.<p>
<b>???:</b> This was on UFI<A NAME="Index314"></A><a
name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[59]</a>?<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Yes, we were using UFI against the QBE front-end.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> What was the OK Corral?<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> The terminal room, where the RSS was developed.<p>
<b>Brad Wade:</b> After the event, and our visitors had gone, someone - I do
not remember who - made up a sign. I think the sign just said, "The OK Corral."
And somebody stuck it on the door. There was some movie that I remember seeing
when I was ten years old; some famous western gun-slinging shoot-out.<p>
<b>Irv Traiger:</b> Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday and Hirsh Cohen.<i>
[laughter]</i> <p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> <i>High Noon</i>.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> So that's exactly what happened, and it was great, and we
called it the OK Corral after that, always the shoot-out. What happened was QBE
continued as an IUP<a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[60]</a>, but it never really
went anywhere; it was never significantly enhanced. Santa Teresa didn't want to
take it. DP, which was the sales division that supported the IUPs, continued
selling it but didn't invest in it.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> Didn't it get reimplemented as part of DB2?<p>
<b>various:</b> QMF<A NAME="Index315"></A><A NAME="Index316"></A><a
name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[61]</a><A NAME="Index317"></A>.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Sorry. Yes.<p>
<b>Roger Miller:</b> It didn't become a very popular usage even in QMF.<p>
<b>Roger Bamford:</b> We cloned it.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> That's interesting.<p>
<b>Paul McJones:</b> It's now called Microsoft Access.<i> [laughter]</i><p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Some version of that will probably win.<p>
<b>C. Mohan:</b> But other companies are implementing it, right? Paradox and
all sorts of guys are implementing it.<p>
<b>Roger Bamford:</b> I think the original objections are true: anything
complicated is impossible. Our customers are using SQL statements that go on
for pages. In QBE that would put you against the wall??? ... take all the joins
and everything.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> So there was a report. What I remember about the report
was a ringing endorsement of the RSS. <p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> The index component in particular.<i> [laughter]</i><p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> I think they especially liked the locking; I think they
loved the use of Compare-And-Swap-Double.<i> [laughter]</i> And then there was
some ambiguous recommendation, I don't know what ever happened to it, but as
far as I know, Zloof never got the RSS. Peter de Jong went to MIT and is still
there.<p>
<b>Brad Wade:</b> And Mosh&eacute;; where is Mosh&eacute; these days?<p>
<b>C. Mohan:</b> HP Labs. He started his own company, that didn't fly, then he
joined Ashton-Tate; now he's with HP Labs.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> And Peter is at Apollo doing transactions inside of CORBA; HP
Apollo.<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> What happened to Mosh&eacute; Zloof is he went on to
something called Office by Example. In fact that talk that I gave about the
SQL/DS; the next speaker was Mosh&eacute; about Office by Example - OBE. He got
a whole group of about twenty-five young, real programmers - not designers - he
was real careful about to hire programmers. So he had a bunch of people and he
got them to give him his own building - the Bernen House at Yorktown<A NAME="Index318"></A>,
and he took it over, and he was going to build a PC product. Gomory supported
it completely. And then one day, the management changed - I think it had to do
with Birnbaum's departure and the reannointment of Herb Schorr, and then maybe
Abe Peled on staff. Somehow that set of people ganged up and said, "We're not
going to support that at the level it's being supported," which was thirty
people times a hundred thousand - three million dollars a year. And
Mosh&eacute; didn't like this, and eventually left IBM. And so he formed his
own company as a startup to do it - I guess it didn't work - went to
Ashton-Tate; Ashton-Tate was bought by Borland, then he went to HP.<p>
<b>C. Mohan:</b> He's now doing Rendering by Example<a name="fnB58"
href="#fn58">[62]</a> - easy-to-do programming by example. So maybe he's going
back to the System for Business Automation kind of stuff.<p>
