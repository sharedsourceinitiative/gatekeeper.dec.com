Morton Astrahan</H2>
<b>Don Chamberlin:</b> Morton<A NAME="Index10"></A>
was a real unusual guy. I first met Morton when I transferred to California
along with Ray Boyce and Frank King<A NAME="Index11"></A>,
Vera Watson, and some other people, in 1973. This was a large infusion of new
people into the environment at San Jose, which had a project underway, and that
project of course was impacted by the arrival of the newcomers, and different
people had different attitudes about that. The term "Yorktown Mafia<A NAME="Index12"></A>"
is indicative of one of the attitudes; Morton never used that term. Morton's
attitude toward newcomers was, "Welcome to California. How can I make you guys
feel at home?" Since not everybody felt that way, it was real nice to have
Morton around, because Morton knew the ropes and he was the guy who helped us
find places to live and places to shop and things to do at night. He was real
nice that way, to make us feel like we were welcome by the natives. I say that
although I'm a native of San Jose.<p>
Morton had a cabin up in the mountains that he called Serendipity<A NAME="Index13"></A>.
Serendipity, as you know, means a kind of a surprising good outcome. I never
figured out exactly why Morton's cabin was called Serendipity, but that cabin
was an important thing to Morton, and one of the things that he did was to
invite all of the newcomers from New York, one at a time, up to his mountain on
the weekends. So we went up there and took our young daughter and it was a
beautiful place and Morton really enjoyed sharing it with people. Morton
claimed that he had a muse that lived in Serendipity and whenever there was
some kind of technical problem that came up in our project that had everybody
scratching their head, Morton would tend to disappear for several days at a
time and would go up and consult his muse. A lot of times he'd come back and
he'd have the problem solved. I thought that was pretty nice. When Morton
disappeared, I always looked forward to what he'd have to say when he came
back.<p>
One of the things about Morton was he didn't really like to argue, and just
about everybody else in the project liked to argue a lot<i> [laughter]</i>, so
this made Morton kind of unique. Something that would happen a lot of the time
was everybody would have meetings all week and do a lot of shouting over some
technical issue, and by the time the dust sort of cleared, here would be
Morton, who hadn't come to the meeting and sat in his office and wrote code all
week, and he'd have the problem solved. He was real productive and real fast
that way. He got a lot done with kind of a minimum amount of heat and political
energy.<p>
Another thing that I remember about Morton was his courage. Morton had a lot of
health problems: he had Parkinson's Disease and he had crippling arthritis so
he couldn't stand up straight and I think he was real uncomfortable a lot of
the time. But I never heard Morton mention that a single time to anybody and it
never limited any of his activities. You know, Morton was always first in line
and had more energy than anyone else. It must have been very uncomfortable for
him and taken a lot of courage to do that. But, you know, Morton was always
kind of right out there carrying more than his share.<p>
Morton retired from IBM sometime in the mid 1980's - I don't recall the exact
date - and he died shortly after that - probably 1986 or thereabouts.<p>
Morton is somebody who I remember for his courage and friendship and
constructive attitude. If you had something you needed done without a lot of
fooling around, then Morton was the guy you wanted to get in touch with.
