Ray Boyce</H2>
<b>Don Chamberlin:</b> Working with Ray<A NAME="Index1"></A>
was one of the great privileges I've had in my career. I didn't get to do it
for very long, but it's something I'll always remember. Ray grew up in New York
State on the west side of the Hudson River. He went to college in Providence,
Rhode Island. He met his wife Sandy there. She was a nursing student. He got
his PhD in Purdue and he was one of the few people I ever met who actually
liked it in West Lafayette, Indiana. After he left Purdue he joined the group
that I was working in, in Yorktown Heights, New York, where we were just
beginning to work on database projects under Frank King<A NAME="Index2"></A>.<p>
Ray was a person who made things happen. He was a very smart and very ambitious
guy and had a lot of energy. I really think Ray, if he'd lived, would have been
in the class with Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison and Bill Gates - everybody would
know Ray's name, I think, if he was alive today. Ray and I worked together in a
very close collaboration in the early days on the SQL language - it was called
SEQUEL in those days. This collaboration was so close that at the end of the
day neither one of us could remember what ideas each one of us had contributed
to the work. So it was a very close partnership. The main difference between
Ray and me was Ray was a lot more interested in management than I was, so when
it came time to choose a manager for the group, Ray was the one who got the
job, and I thought that was a real good division of labor. So Ray was my boss
for a while.<p>
He and Sandy had a daughter Kristen just a few months after they arrived in
California. Ray and Irv Traiger were the two managers under Frank King in the
early days of System R. I had a car pool with Ray and one day in the spring of
1974 I drove Ray to work and after lunch I heard a kind of rumor in the
building that Ray had collapsed at lunch time. He was the picture of health -
he was strong and vigorous and I didn't have any clue that he had any sort of
health problems. One day at lunch he just kind of fell over, and he was taken
to the hospital. He had an aneurysm of the brain, which is a blood vessel that
swells up and bursts inside the brain. He was taken to Valley Medical Center
and was operated on and lived for a short time after his operation, but he died
on Father's Day in 1974. His daughter was only about nine months old when he
died.<p>
His wife and daughter still live in San Jose and we've kept in close touch with
them over the years. Sandy went back to school and got her master's degree in
clinical psychology. She's working as a counselor now for children and foster
parents. Kristen grew up and went to the University of California at Santa
Barbara where she still is - my daughter is there, too. She got married last
year and will graduate from UCSB this year with a bachelor's degree and she's
going to stay there and work on her teaching credential.<p>
So I think the most important things to Ray were his work and his family. I
think he would have been real proud of what became of his work. In the short
period that he had, which was not quite two years long, he invented Boyce-Codd<A NAME="Index3"></A><A NAME="Index4"></A>
Normal Form, which is still taught in textbooks; he developed the SQL language,
which some people still remember. So I think he would have been real proud of
that, and I think he would have been real proud of the way his family turned
out. I wish Ray could have known the impact his work would have had.
