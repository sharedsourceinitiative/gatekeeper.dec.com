Teradata; Ingres family: Relational Technology, Britton-Lee, Sybase, Microsoft</H2>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> So, let's see. Teradata<A NAME="Index447"></A>.
So here's just some background. There was a guy by the name of Phil Neches<A NAME="Index448"></A>
at UCLA, and he said, "We ought to do parallelism on commodity hardware." He
fell in with some people at a startup, and they started this company, and I
guess in about 1984 shipped the first parallel SQL engine. It's very similar to
the Tandem story: it's a sort of one-trick pony. It doesn't have referential
integrity; it doesn't have all the fanciness. You give it SQL; it gives you
back the answers, very fast, and presumably cheaply, because it's running on
Intel processors and on commodity disks. Teradata got bought by NCR<A NAME="Index449"></A>;
NCR got bought by AT&amp;T<A NAME="Index450"></A>;
and AT&amp;T last I heard ...<p>
Along those lines, there was this whole other development, which was the INGRES<A NAME="Index451"></A>
project at U.C. Berkeley<A NAME="Index452"></A>.
The INGRES project had a language called QUEL<A NAME="Index453"></A>.
They started a company that implemented QUEL. QUEL fought SQL tooth-and-nail,
and explained how QUEL was better than SQL in many different ways, and in fact
it is better at doing aggregates. There are lots of areas where QUEL is better.
Some people at Ingres now feel that the reason that they were less than
successful is because they fought SQL rather than embraced it, so this gave
Oracle a chance to differentiate themselves. The fact is that ...<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> Just as a point of time: I had a conversation on the phone
with Stonebraker<A NAME="Index454"></A>
while I was living in Washington, and I left Washington in June of 1983. So
it's obviously prior to that. I said, "I think Oracle is going to do well." He
said, "Why is that?" I said, "Because they are one of the few who support SQL
besides IBM." He said, "Well that status won't last more than a few weeks.
Everybody's on that; that's done." So by, I would say, the end of 1982 or the
beginning of 1983, they were far over that; they had made that decision. I
don't know when they shipped their first code.<p>
<b>Tom Price:</b> Although the first code they shipped was SQL on top of QUEL<A NAME="Index455"></A>
...<p>
<b>Mike Blasgen:</b> It was see-QUEL.<i> [laughter]</i> That's right.<p>
<b>Tom Price:</b> Which made me nervous about buying it.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> And so there was that thread. And spun off from the INGRES<A NAME="Index456"></A>
project was a Britton-Lee<A NAME="Index457"></A>
group. And the Britton-Lee group included Paula Hawthorn<A NAME="Index458"></A>
and Bob Epstein<A NAME="Index459"></A>
and Mike Ubell<A NAME="Index460"></A>
and probably a lot of other people. And they built a database machine<a
name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[81]</a>. In that era, there was this whole notion
that you could really do much better by building a special-purpose piece of
hardware and a special-purpose operating system and then a database system.
Build up from the bare metal and it's going to run a lot faster. I think Roger
mentioned that that was part of the Esvel concept as well. Louise Madrid<A NAME="Index461"></A>
was another ...<p>
<b>Roger Bamford:</b> I think we really believed you could get the revenue for
it; I don't think we really believed that it was cheaper to build; it was just
easier to sell.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> And the performance would be better. I think that was one of
the arguments, that you couldn't get good performance on general-purpose; the
special-purpose would beat ...<p>
<b>Don Slutz:</b> Lot of special hardware.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> They had an accelerator, which was their hook ... The
Britton-Lee<A NAME="Index462"></A>
guys in turn spun off Sybase, and Sybase<A NAME="Index463"></A>
came out. The key thing about Sybase as far as I can tell was they ran on UNIX<A NAME="Index464"></A>;
they didn't use any of the UNIX services except a single process. They used raw
disks; they took a single process and multithreaded it, and ran SQL inside of
that, or actually ran DB-Library<A NAME="Index465"></A>.
They were not very SQL enthusiast or compliant. They had the QUEL<A NAME="Index466"></A>
tradition; they were from INGRES<A NAME="Index467"></A>.
So the key thing that allowed them to be successful is they had great
performance. You would send one request in; it would work all inside of this
process; no operating system dispatches, no operating system I/Os, just raw
disk I/Os. So they were like a factor of three better than everybody else in
terms of performance. They managed to establish themselves as the
client/server, open, database thing.<p>
<b>Tom Price:</b> They did a deal with Microsoft<A NAME="Index468"></A>.<p>
<b>Jim Gray:</b> And Microsoft took their code and sold it on OS/2<A NAME="Index469"></A>.
The reason for that was that about 1986, IBM was trying to take over the PC
market, and they had their own operating system - OS/2 - they had their own
hardware. Microsoft said that they had to somehow protect themselves against
something called OS/2 Extended Edition. There was going to be this thing called
OS/2, which was basic OS/2, and then Extended Edition, which was going to cost
hardly anything more, was going to have a database system in it, and compilers,
and query - QBE was going to be built into it, and all sorts of stuff. So
Microsoft felt they had to have something like that. So they went to Sybase<A NAME="Index470"></A>
and said, "We'll get our SQL engine from the Sybase guys, and that will be our
Microsoft Extended Edition." And Microsoft remarketed Sybase in the OS/2 world.
The relations between Microsoft and Sybase were not warm or cordial. When it
came time to port Sybase to NT, Sybase let Microsoft do the job. And then there
was a divorce at some point, similar to the IBM divorce about OS/2, that IBM
would do OS/2, and Microsoft would go its own way. There was a similar divorce
vis-&agrave;-vis Microsoft, where Microsoft now owns the Sybase code, so the
Microsoft SQL Server now is going its own way, and they've made it more
SQL-compliant, and they're adding GUIs to it, and so on. It's now a major force
in this whole database world. And the thing that's driving everybody crazy I
believe in the database world is, this thing is very cheap. It's, order, five
thousand dollars for a server, as opposed to a hundred thousand dollars for a
server. This server is capable of doing hundreds of transactions a second.
Scary. Pat, did I ... ?
