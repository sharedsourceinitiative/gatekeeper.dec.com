There are two APIs, one for the predictor and one for the solver, each defined
in a separate header file. As mentioned earlier, these APIs perform the core
prediction and analysis algorithms, but do not provide application-specific
functionality such as nonvolatile storage or communication. The next section of
this document, <b>Sample</b> <b>Application</b>, shows how to integrate the
APIs with a complete application.<p>
Both APIs are "thread-safe", that is the implementations do all necessary
locking so that concurrent calls by multiple threads function correctly.<p>
<i>Note</i>: We assume that the target platform's mutual exclusion primitives
are fast relative to the time for a call on the prediction procedures.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">eetypes.h</A></h2>

This
header file gives the types used in the <b><i>Schema</i></b>,
<b><i>eepredict.h</i></b>, and <b><i>eesolve.h</i></b> sections. We say that
the types used to identify persons and items, <tt>ee_person</tt> and
<tt>ee_item</tt> respectively, are <i>opaque</i>, meaning that the Each to Each
code doesn't assume anything about them, such as whether or not there are
"gaps" in the range of values in use. The one exception is that the values
<tt>ee_person_null</tt> and <tt>ee_item_null</tt> should never be assigned to a
real person or item; they are reserved for use as a special indicator value,
such as indicating when an "iterator" has no more values to return (see
<tt>ee_solve::person_iterator</tt> and <tt>ee_solve::item_iterator</tt> in
eesolve.h).

<pre>

typedef int ee_bool;
class ee_person {                          // an opaque uid for a person
public:
    int uid;
    ee_person(int uu = 0): uid(uu) {};
};
inline int operator==(const ee_person&amp; x, const ee_person&amp; xx)
{ return x.uid == xx.uid; }
const ee_person ee_person_null(0);         // unused "null" value
class ee_item {                            // an opaque uid for an item
public:
    int uid;
    ee_item(int uu = 0): uid(uu) {};
};
inline int operator==(const ee_item&amp; y, const ee_item&amp; yy)
{ return y.uid == yy.uid; }
const ee_item ee_item_null(0);             // unused "null" value

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">Schema</A></h2>

The
Each to Each solver and predictor require nonvolatile storage of some
information about each person, each item, and each vote on an item by a person.
For reasons of portability and flexibility, this storage is not managed
directly by the Each to Each software. Instead, it is managed by
application-specific code and is made accessible to the Each to Each software
as part of the APIs defined in the next section of this document.<p>
Here we define the logical schema as if this information is stored in a
relational database with five tables, <tt>Persons</tt>, <tt>Items</tt>,
<tt>Votes</tt>, <tt>VotesLog</tt>, and <tt>Generations</tt>. Of course, the
application programmer is free to merge these tables with existing tables, or
to implement them in a different storage medium such as a file system, subject
to performance considerations.<p>
The <tt>Persons</tt> table contains records of the form: 

<pre>

    ee_person person;    // unique key
    ee_model model;
</pre>
The
<tt>Items</tt> table contains records of the form:

<pre>

    ee_item item;        // unique key
    ee_model model;
</pre>
The
<tt>Votes</tt> table contains records of the form:

<pre>

    ee_person person;    // unique key: person, item
    ee_item item;
    ee_vote vote;
</pre>
The
<tt>VotesLog</tt> table contains records of the form:

<pre>

    ee_person person;    // unique key: person, item, time
    ee_item item;
    ee_vote vote;
    timestamp time;      // (e.g., DATE) indexed by time
</pre>
The
<tt>VotesLog</tt> table helps the solver process detect updates to the
<tt>Votes</tt> table made by the predictor process as it records new votes.
Every transaction that modifies (inserts, updates, or deletes a record in)
<tt>Votes</tt> must also insert a corresponding record in <tt>VotesLog</tt>. A
deletion to <tt>Votes</tt> is indicated by a record in <tt>VotesLog</tt> with
<tt>v</tt> equal to <tt>ee_vote_null</tt>. The <tt>time</tt> field determines
the order in which the solver processes the entries, and so must have enough
precision to resolve successive updates to a vote, e.g., when a person decides
to change or delete a vote.<p>
The <tt>Generations</tt> table contains a single record of the form:

<pre>

    int id;              // always equal to one
    int generation;      // initially equal to zero
</pre>
The
<tt>Generations</tt> table helps the predictor process notice updates to the
<tt>Items</tt> table made by the solver process. Each time the solver has
completed a set of updates to the <tt>Items</tt> table, it must update the
record in <tt>the</tt> <tt>Generations</tt> table by increasing the generation
field by one.
<a name="_Toc400263150"></a>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading7">Consistency</A></h2>

The
Each to Each APIs were designed in such a way that very few consistency
constraints on the data are required:<p>
1.	The models in the <tt>Persons</tt> and <tt>Items</tt> tables don't have to
be updated atomically; they may be from different runs of the solver.<p>
2.	If there is a vote for a person or item without a model, a model will be
generated internally and will be available from <tt>get_*_model</tt>, etc. If
there is a person or item without any votes, its model will be very near the
null model.<p>
3.	The <tt>VotesLog</tt> table, if applied to the <tt>Votes</tt> table (doing
the insertions, modifications, deletions), gives the "truth" from which the
system works. It is therefore okay for the <tt>VotesLog</tt> table to contain votes
that have already been applied to the <tt>Votes</tt> table.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">eepredict.h</A></h2>

This
header file defines a single class <tt>ee_predict</tt>, which provides
functions to generate person-item predictions and also person-person
correlations. The <tt>ee_predict</tt> class doesn't have direct access to the
nonvolatile storage in which votes and models are stored. Instead, when it
needs a particular piece of information, it calls one of two <i>virtual
functions</i>, <tt>get_person_votes</tt> or <tt>get_item_model</tt>. These
functions are implemented in a class derived from <tt>ee_predict</tt> that is
implemented by the client. See the <b>Sample</b> <b>Application</b> section for
details.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading9">eesolve.h</A></h2>

This
header file defines a single class <tt>ee_solve</tt>, which provides functions
to analyze a set of votes, producing a compact set of models that can be used
by <tt>ee_predict</tt> to generate predictions. Like <tt>ee_predict</tt>, the
<tt>ee_solve</tt> class doesn't have direct access to the nonvolatile storage
in which votes and models are used. Rather than using virtual functions,
<tt>ee_solve</tt> provides ordinary functions to supply it with votes and
(optionally) models, and to retrieve refined models.<p>
<tt>ee_solve</tt> uses an iterative refinement algorithm. The longer this
algorithm runs, the more accurate the predictions that are generated from the
models it produces. The progress of the algorithm is reflected in a quantity
called the <i>residue</i>, which measures the remaining opportunity for further
refinement. The residue is proportional to the count of votes, decreases with
time, and approaches an asymptote greater than zero. Functions are provided to
retrieve the current residue and the count of votes. <p>
It's possible to do a "cold start" of <tt>ee_solve</tt>, giving it only a set
of votes. However, it will more quickly reach low residue values if it is given
models from a previous run as well as the set of votes. As shown in the
<b><i>Sample Application</i></b> section, it can be run continously by
supplying it with a log of changes to the <tt>Votes</tt> database.
