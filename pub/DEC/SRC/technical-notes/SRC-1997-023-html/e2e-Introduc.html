This document describes how to incorporate the Each to Each recommendation
technology in a complete application. Each to Each applies collaborative
filtering techniques to the problem of making subjective recommendations to
consumers faced with "infoglut". The basic idea is to ask people to vote for
items on a numeric scale, then perform a statistical analysis of the collection
of all people's votes, and use the results of the analysis to predict
additional items of potential interest to a particular person. Unlike some
competitive approaches, the Each to Each technology separates prediction from
analysis, allows predictions to be made using compact "models" produced by the
analysis, and provides meaningful predictions after a person has provided just
a few votes.<p>
The general goal of the APIs presented in this document is to separate core
recommendation functionality from application-dependent features such as choice
of platform, database, communication mechanism, etc. Implementing the "glue"
code to connect these APIs into a complete application is straightforward.<p>
The APIs are written in C++, but avoid advanced C++ features (e.g., no multiple
inheritance, templates, or exceptions). Bindings for other languages (e.g.,
Java, C) would not be difficult to design.<p>
This document describes everything needed for pure vote-based predictions of
person-item and person-person affinity (the latter to be used for choosing
reviews of potential interest to a person). The appendix describes an
enhancement called categories, which allow the use of demographic information
and item categorization information in predictions. We have little experience
with categories.<p>
The technology is available for licensing; see <b><i>Appendix B: Technology
Availability</i></b>.

<A NAME="Heading2">Overview of an Each to Each application</A></h2>

The
Each to Each technology separates prediction from analysis. Prediction involves
interacting with a person to record his votes or ratings of specific items,
computing predicted ratings, and providing them back to the person. Analysis
involves applying a statistical algorithm to the collection of votes gathered
from all people, producing a compact set of <i>models</i> used to drive future
predictions.<p>
The prediction component, or <i>predictor</i> for short, is inherently
interactive. The analysis component, or <i>solver</i> for short, does not need
to have low-latency communication with the prediction function or the user
interface. In a typical internet application, the predictor runs as an
application gateway, accessed via an interface such as CGI, NSAPI, or ISAPI,
while the solver runs as a stand-alone process, perhaps on a different server
computer. In a retail kiosk application, the predictor runs in the kiosk
computer while the solver runs at a central data center; periodic dial-up
communication is used to send votes to the solver and updated models to the
kiosks. Finally, in a CD-ROM application, the predictor runs on a personal
computer, using pre-computed models stored on the CD-ROM. Votes are stored on
the local hard drive, and optionally sent to a central data center via dial-up
communication and/or the Internet. Here is a diagram showing the overall data
flow:<p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">Terminology</A></h2>

We
have already introduced the terms predictor and solver. We should point out
that we use the term "predictor" to refer to two different things: the
<tt>ee_predict</tt> API in the Each to Each SDK and the component of an
application that records new votes and generates predictions. Similarly, we use
the term "solver" to refer both to the <tt>ee_solve</tt> API and the component
of an application that calls this API.<p>
There are a few other terms with special meanings in this document:<p>
<i>Person</i>: someone who votes for items and asks for recommendations.<p>
<i>Item</i>: something that can be voted on.<p>
<i>Vote</i>: actual or predicted assessment of an item by a person, consisting
of a score and a weight.<p>
<i>Score</i>: a numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher numbers mean
more positive assessments.<p>
<i>Weight</i>: a nonnegative floating-point value. On input to Each to Each,
weights have a linear interpretation (e.g., .5 means half as confident as 1.0),
but the particular scale (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0 or 0.0 to 10.0) doesn't matter. On
output from Each to Each, weights are approximate and ordered but not linear
and will be between 0.0 and 1.0. Determining appropriate thresholds upon which
to base recommendations typically requires a bit of application-dependent
tuning.<p>
<i>Model</i>: a block of data (currently 128 bytes in length) computed by the
solver for each person and for each item. The predictor functions use the model
in fast algorithms for predicting votes and correlations.
