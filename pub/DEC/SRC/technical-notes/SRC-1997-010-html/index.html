<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>This paper describes an outline processor display of Web pages. We
attach icons, called zippers, to the HTML heading tags (H1, H2, ...), and
the user can dynamically include or elide the body of each section by clicking
on the zipper. We have implemented zippers in three different ways: zippers
that are inserted by a custom-built Web browser and that control the browser's
display engine; zippers that are inserted into the HTML document by a Web
proxy and that use the proxy to generate modified HTML reflecting the changed
state of the zipper; and zippers that trigger a JavaScript program which
redisplays an appropriately modified version of the page. </I></P>

<P><I>A good way to experience the ideas presented here is to view the
<A HREF="script.html">outline version of this paper</A>. You will
need to use Netscape Navigator 3 or higher. </I></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>As people rush to put information onto the World Wide Web, more and
more structured documents are appearing. These documents include home pages
with lots of hierarchically organized links, papers with many sections
and subsections, and other lengthy documents such as books and manuals.</P>

<P> All Web browsers that we know of display each page as a continuous
scroll. Unfortunately, it is easy to lose context when viewing a snippet
of the whole, and it is hard to jump to arbitrary places in the page. These
problems become more severe with longer pages.</P>

<P> Outline processors provide one well known technique for addressing
these problems. Outline processors allow a user to expand and contract
selected sections and subsections of a document, thus retaining the high-level
structure of the document while also displaying individual sections. In
addition, outline processors allow the user to rapidly jump within the
document.</P>

<P> This paper describes how we have integrated outline processor technology
into Web browsers. We use the heading tags (i.e., H1, H2, ..., H6) in the
HTML source to derive an outline structure of the document, and we mark
each heading with an icon called a <I>zipper</I>. Clicking on the zipper
causes the section introduced by the heading to expand and contract. Re-expanding
a section causes the state of all subsections to reappear as they were
before the section was contracted.</P>

<P> The three screen dumps below show different states of a session in
which we viewed the HTTP 1.0 specification. The well-structured hierarchy
of this document makes it ideal for outline viewing. The left screen dump
shows the document with the top-level zipper expanded (&quot;open&quot;)
and all second-level zippers contracted (&quot;closed&quot;). In the middle
screen dump, the user has opened the zipper of section 10; and in the screen
dump on the right, he has further opened subsections 10.2, 10.5, and 10.7.</P>

<P>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next three sections
describe three alternative implementations of zippers: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="#approach1">first approach</A> is to build a custom Web
browser that inserts zipper buttons into the display of HTML pages. Because
the buttons are not part of the HTML but are widgets of the browser, they
can access the browser directly. Clicking on a button causes the browser
to change the state of the zipper and to redisplay the page.</LI>

<P> </P>

<LI>The <A HREF="#approach2">second approach</A> is to build a proxy that
inserts zippers into HTML pages, which then can be viewed by a standard
Web browser. In this approach, zippers are represented through standard
HTML, as links attached to images. Clicking on a zipper sends an HTTP request
to the proxy, which causes it to generate a new HTML page.</LI>

<P> </P>

<LI>The <A HREF="#approach3">third approach</A> is to build a transducer
that inserts a script (e.g., JavaScript or VBScript) into the HTML page.
The script, executed by a suitable Web browser, generates an outline view
of the page. Clicking on a zipper causes the browser to re-execute the
script, which then generates an appropriately updated outline view of the
page. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Following that, we discuss <A HREF="#discussion">related work</A>. Finally,
we offer some <A HREF="#conclusion">concluding thoughts</A> on the merits
of zippers and on the general applicability of the various implementation
alternatives we explored.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2><A NAME="approach1"></A>Approach 1: A Custom Web Browser</H2>

<P>We have built a family of Web browsers that support zippers. These browsers
are implemented in Modula-3, an object-oriented language akin to Java.
Modula-3 comes with a sophisticated UI toolkit, called Trestle <A HREF="#trestle">[5]</A>.</P>

<P> In Trestle, each window is organized as a tree of widgets, called &quot;virtual
bitmap terminals,&quot; or VBTs. VBTs can be classified by the number of
their children. Leaf VBTs have no children; they are used for displaying
text and images, for scrollbars, for type-in fields, and so on. Filter
VBTs have a single child and modify it in some way, such as by adding a
border, by making it reactive to mouse clicks, and so on. Finally, split
VBTs have an arbitrary number of children, and typically arrange their
children spatially or temporally. For example, a horizontal box arranges
its children horizontally, a vertical box arranges them vertically, a pack
split arranges them like words in a paragraph, and a temporal split displays
one child at a time.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>The WebVBT Widget</H3>

<P>New VBTs are often created by combining existing VBTs. The heart of
our Web browsers is a VBT for fetching and displaying a URL. Individual
words are displayed through text VBTs, images through image VBTs, and white
space and horizontal rules through texture VBTs. The basic elements of
HTML forms are implemented using the corresponding VBTs, e.g., type-in
fields, buttons, check boxes, and radios. These leaf VBTs are combined
into paragraphs using a pack split, and the paragraphs are arranged into
pages by vertical boxes.</P>

<P> Below is the interface of the WebVBT class. For the sake of simplicity,
we do not show the methods related to image maps, index pages, and forms.
We also don't show the methods for fine tuning display attributes such
as fonts and colors.</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE>  INTERFACE WebVBT;
  IMPORT VBT;
  TYPE
    T = VBT.T OBJECT
      page: Page := NIL;
    METHODS
      init (): T;
      fetch (url: TEXT);
      stop ();
      ready (n: CARDINAL); 
      hotlink (link: TEXT; cd: VBT.MouseRec); 
    END;

    Page &lt;: ROOT;

    HTMLPage = Page OBJECT
    METHODS
      getBase(): TEXT;
      getTitle(): TEXT;
      ...
    END;
  END WebVBT.
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>init</TT> method initializes the WebVBT and leaves it blank.
The <TT>fetch</TT> method (eventually) displays the contents of the <TT>url</TT>
parameter. More precisely, it cancels any fetching in progress, forks a
thread to actually retrieve the contents of the URL, and then returns.
The <TT>stop</TT> method is used to cancel any ongoing fetches.</P>

<P> The <TT>ready</TT> method will be called by an ongoing <TT>fetch</TT>
operation when the page (but not necessarily all of its images or applets)
has been retrieved. At this point, the <TT>page</TT> field has been set
to an object that is specific to the MIME type of the document. Fetching
continues until all of the images and applets have been loaded, and the
<TT>ready</TT> method is called each time that an image or applet is loaded,
with the <TT>n</TT> parameter updated to indicate the number of images
and applets still to be loaded. The default <TT>ready</TT> method does
nothing; client applications using WebVBT may override this method.</P>

<P> The <TT>hotlink</TT> method is called each time the user clicks on
a hyperlink in the displayed Web page. The default method does nothing;
the typical WebVBT client overrides it to fetch the target of the hyperlink,
specified by the <TT>link</TT> parameter.</P>

<P> The following is a <I>fully-functional</I> Web browser; it starts out
at the Alta Vista home page:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE>  MODULE Main;
  IMPORT Trestle, VBT, Web, WebVBT;

  PROCEDURE HotLink(self: WebVBT.T; link: TEXT; cd: VBT.MouseRec) =
    VAR page: WebVBT.HTMLPage := self.page;
    BEGIN
      self.fetch(Web.AbsoluteURL(page.getBase(), link);
    END HotLink;

  VAR v := NEW(WebVBT.T, hotlink := HotLink).init();
  BEGIN
    v.fetch(&quot;http://www.altavista.digital.com/&quot;);
    Trestle.Install(v);
    Trestle.AwaitDelete(v);
  END Main.
</PRE>

<H3>Adding Zippers to WebVBT</H3>

<P>The ease with which new VBTs can be composed from existing ones makes
it very easy to implement zippers. In particular, zippers make use of two
types of VBTs: a button (with one of two images, to indicate the expanded
or contracted state) and a temporal split (to show either a heading alone
or a heading and its body).</P>

<P> The WebVBT walks the internal representation of the parsed HTML, looking
for heading tags (H1, H2, ...). Each time it finds a tag, a new temporal
split is created. The temporal split has two children. One child is the
zipper button in the closed state along with the heading text. The other
child is a vertical box containing the zipper button in the open state
along with the heading text, followed by the body of the section and all
its subsections.</P>

<P> Clicking on a zipper button toggles which child of the temporal split
is displayed. Shift-clicking on a zipper button toggles the heading and
visits all subheadings, setting the state of their zippers to match that
of the clicked zipper.</P>

<P> The screen dumps below show DeckScape <A HREF="#deckscape">[3]</A>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="approach2"></A>Approach 2: A Web Proxy</H2>

<P>The main drawback of the approach described in the previous section
is that it limits users to our custom Web browser. Custom browsers are
problematic because of the rapid evolution of HTML and the resources required
to match the feature set of the two industry-leading browsers.</P>

<P> An alternative approach for implementing outline views of Web pages
is to build a Web proxy that dynamically changes the HTML of retrieved
pages, and services requests by the user to expand or contract parts of
the outline view. We have implemented such a &quot;zipper proxy,&quot;
intended to be run on the same machine as the Web browser. Users can configure
their standard Web browser to hand all HTTP requests to the zipper proxy.
</P>

<P>Conceptually, the zipper proxy maintains a table that reflects the outline
state of all documents retrieved so far. Each retrieved document is assigned
a unique &quot;document number&quot;. A table entry consists of the document's
URL, its number, and an array of boolean values (called the &quot;state
vector&quot;). The length of the array corresponds to the number of potential
zippers, i.e. the number of heading tags in the document, and each entry
reflects the state of one zipper.</P>

<P> When the browser requests a document for the first time, the proxy
retrieves the document from the appropriate Web server, and parses the
HTTP header to determine the document's MIME type. If the document is not
of type &quot;text/html&quot;, it is immediately forwarded to the browser.
Otherwise, the proxy parses the HTML to determine the number of heading
tags, creates a state vector with one entry per heading, initializes it
such that all zippers are closed, and adds an entry consisting of the document's
URL, its number, and the state vector to the table. Furthermore, the proxy
uses the document's original HTML and the state vector to generate a modified
version of the document, which is then returned to the browser.</P>

<P> The way in which the proxy modifies a document's HTML is key to understanding
the zipper proxy technique. First, the proxy inserts an <TT>Expires:0</TT>
field into the HTTP header, replacing any existing <TT>Expires:</TT> field.
The 0 value indicates that the document expires immediately and should
therefore not be cached by the Web browser. The proxy then scans over the
HTML of the original document, until it encounters a heading tag. </P>

<P>Assume the zipper proxy runs on machine &quot;ash&quot;, is processing
document number 5 (whose URL is <TT>http://www.carroll.com/poems.html</TT>),
and just encountered the third heading: </P>

<PRE>    &lt;H2&gt;The Walrus and the Carpenter&lt;/H2&gt;
</PRE>

<P>If the state vector indicates that the zipper corresponding to this
heading is open, the proxy replaces the heading with the following HTML
code: </P>

<PRE>    &lt;H2&gt;
      &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://ash/zip&amp;5&amp;3&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG BORDER=0 SRC=&quot;http://ash/open.xbm&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
      The Walrus and the Carpenter
    &lt;/H2&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The URL <TT>http://ash/open.xbm</TT> refers to the image of an open
zipper, available from the zipper proxy. After replacing the original with
the modified heading, the proxy continues to scan for headings.</P>

<P> If the state vector indicates that the zipper is closed, the proxy
replaces the heading in a similar fashion, but uses the image of a closed
zipper instead. Furthermore, it will omit all the HTML between this heading
and the next H1 or H2 heading from the modified document.</P>

<P> The net result of this rewriting process is that the user is presented
with a outline view of the document. Headings that are not elided are preceded
by zipper icons. The zippers are enclosed into HTML anchors; clicking on
a zipper sends an HTTP request to the zipper proxy. Encoded in this request
is the number of the document and of the zipper that is to be toggled.
The zipper proxy uses those two numbers to update the document's state
vector accordingly, and then generates a new modified version of the document,
based on the original HTML and the updated state vector.</P>

<P> If the proxy were to simply return the modified HTML, the browser would
display the updated document, but show the wrong URL (e.g. a URL of the
form <TT>http://ash/zip&amp;5&amp;3</TT> instead of <TT>http://www.carroll.com/poems.html</TT>).
The proxy avoids this problem by returning a &quot;moved temporarily&quot;
status code instead: </P>

<PRE>    HTTP/1.0 302 ok
    Location: http://www.carroll.com/poems.html
</PRE>

<P>This causes the Web browser (transparently to the user) to emit a second
HTTP request, this time for the document at URL <TT>http://www.carroll.com/poems.html</TT>.
This request is then intercepted by the proxy, which now returns the modified
HTML, thus causing the browser to display the updated document and associating
it with the correct URL.</P>

<P> As a performance optimization, our zipper proxy implementation caches
<I>n</I> documents, where <I>n</I> is adjustable by the user. The cache
eviction strategy is least-recently used. We cache only documents of MIME
type &quot;text/html&quot;, for three reasons: First, only HTML documents
can contain zippers, and these documents are more likely to be requested
multiple times, since every zipper toggling generates an HTML request for
the document. Second, zipper toggling has to be an instantaneous operation
in order to improve the quality of the user's Web browsing experience.
Third, we assume that documents whose MIME type is not &quot;text/html&quot;
will typically be cached by the Web browser, making it unnecessary for
the proxy to duplicate this caching. After introducing caching and streamlining
the code, we found the human-perceivable performance of the zipper proxy
to be indistinguishable from that of the custom Web browser described in
the previous section.</P>

<P> The zipper proxy is reconfigured by visiting a Web page served by the
proxy that contains a form for adjusting various parameters: the proxy's
port; the IP address and port of an outer proxy (such as the gateway of
a corporate firewall); IP addresses that can be accessed directly, without
going through the outer proxy; the number of parallel threads for servicing
requests; the maximum number of state vectors retained; the maximum number
of cached documents; and whether newly retrieved documents are zipped up
by default or not. The form also provides a button that allows the user
to save those settings to disk. Our proxy also provides a control window
that allows users to switch zipping on and off on a per-document basis.
However, this feature requires a recent version of JavaScript.</P>

<P> The screen dump below shows a Windows 95 desktop with three Netscape
Navigator windows. The leftmost window shows a zipped view of the World
Wide Web Consortium's HTTP overview page, the window to its right shows
the zipper proxy configuration page, and the small window at the far right
shows the zipper proxy control window. </P>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="proxy4.gif"><IMG SRC="proxy4-half.gif" HEIGHT=512 WIDTH=640></A>
</P></CENTER>

<P>Our zipper proxy is available in binary form for Intel/Windows 95 and
for Alpha/Digital Unix platforms at <TT>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/webbrowsing/zipperproxy</TT>.
The current version does not preserve the scroll position of a page when
a zipper is clicked. This problem could be remedied by attaching anchor
names to each zipper. Now, when the proxy receives an HTTP request because
a zipper was clicked, it can add the name of the zipper to the <TT>Location</TT>
field in the &quot;302&quot; reply. Still, this &quot;trick&quot; does
not completely solve the problem: the clicked zipper will move to the top
of the page, causing visual discontinuity. In contrast, our custom Web
browser has no such visual discontinuity. </P>

<H2><A NAME="approach3"></A>Approach 3: HTML Scripting</H2>

<P>The incorporation of scripting languages such as <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/index.html">JavaScript</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript/">VBScript</A> into Web
browsers provides an easy way to enhance a Web page. Scripting code is
embedded into Web pages, and the script is executed while the HTML is parsed
by the browser. The typical use for scripts is to generate HTML on-the-fly
and to associate code with HTML form elements on the page. Some scripting
languages, and JavaScript in particular, are powerful enough to implement
zippers. This script-based implementation differs from the proxy-based
approach in that toggling zippers does not require communication with a
server or a proxy; all computation takes place in a script running inside
the browser. The rest of this section describes a zipper implementation
in JavaScript.</P>

<P>Our script-driven implementation of zippers is based on three observations.
First, an HTML page can be rewritten as a JavaScript program that generates
the HTML as the script is executed. Second, the contents of a Web page
can be modified by redisplaying the current page (thus re-executing the
script) and varying the output of the script. Third, persistent client
state can be used to keep track of the state of the zippers. We now elaborate
on these observations.</P>

<H3>Rewriting HTML as JavaScript</H3>

<P>We can rewrite the following HTML:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;HTML&gt;<BR>
&lt;H1&gt;My Home page&lt;/H1&gt;<BR>
Welcome to my home page ...<BR>
&lt;/HTML&gt;</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>as the JavaScript program:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
function Emit(t) { document.write(t); }<BR>
<BR>
Emit(&quot;&lt;HTML&gt;\n&quot;);<BR>
Emit(&quot;&lt;H1&gt;My Home page&lt;/H1&gt;\n&quot;);<BR>
Emit(&quot;Welcome to my home page ...\n&quot;);<BR>
Emit(&quot;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n&quot;);<BR>
<BR>
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>As the script is executed by the browser, it generates the original
HTML one line at a time.</P>

<H3>Modifying the Contents of a Page</H3>

<P>Multiple, slightly different versions of a page can be obtained by changing
the <TT>Emit</TT> function such that it generates HTML only if a condition
is met (which depends on the state of the zipper):</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>function Emit(t)<BR>
{ if (some_condition) document.write(t); }</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>To keep track of headings in HTML, we introduce a second function, similar
to <TT>Emit</TT>, but taking the heading level as an additional argument.
The purpose of this function is to put appropriate headings into the document:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>function Heading(level, t) <BR>
{ if (...some_condition...) ... document.write(t); ... }</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Here <TT>some_condition</TT> and the elided code refer to JavaScript
that detects if, at the current position and state vector of the document,
the emitted text and headings should be visible or not. Essentially, we
need to keep track of the fact that when a zipper is closed, all text up
to the following heading of the same or a higher level is contracted and
thus not emitted. This is solved using counters to keep track of the current
level and which levels are currently visible.</P>

<P>The outcome of <TT>some_condition</TT> varies as the user opens or closes
zippers. We associate this toggling code with inline images of zipper icons
that reflect the state of the zipper. The code has the function of changing
the state vector and then instructing the browser to redisplay the current
page:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>function Toggle(headingno) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (State(headingno)==1) then SetState(headingno, 0);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;else SetState(headingno, 1);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;history.go(0);<BR>
}</TT><BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>As before, heading numbers are assigned sequentially for each heading
in the document. In this implementation, the state of the zipper is equal
to 1 when open and equal to 0 when closed. The <TT>Heading</TT> function
will emit HTML of the following general form (in this particular case,
to close zipper number 5):</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;JavaScript: Toggle(5);&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;Open.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;<BR>
Heading Text<BR>
&lt;/H2&gt;</TT><BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>The heading, inline image and invocation of the toggle function (the
lines above) are emitted by several JavaScript functions, as the zipper
number to toggle varies according to the heading number, and the inline
image is dependent on the state of the zipper. </P>

<P>Modifying the current contents of a page is done by forcing the browser
to redisplay all of the currently visible page. This is done by calling
<TT>history.go(0)</TT>, which fetches the top page in the history stack.</P>

<P>Although redisplaying the complete page is inefficient, it seldom turns
out to be a problem, because the page is already located in the browser's
cache.</P>

<H3>Keeping Track of the Zipper State</H3>

<P>The only remaining problem is how to keep track of the state of the
zippers. &quot;<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">Cookies</A>&quot;
are a way to associate persistent client state with a specific document,
and JavaScript allows us to inspect and to modify the document's cookie.
We use cookies to save the zipper state of each document as a bit vector.
</P>

<H3>Where to Rewrite?</H3>

<P>The rewriting of the original HTML source into JavaScript can be controlled
by the content provider or by the user. </P>

<P>Content providers can choose to instrument their Web server to transform
documents dynamically as they are requested. The most portable mechanism
to achieve this is the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). In addition, there
are vendor-specific ways to dynamically transform documents, such as Netscape
server plug-ins and Microsoft ISAPI filters. </P>

<P>The content provider can also transform documents in an offline fashion,
and offer the transformed document through a standard Web server. We have
implemented a batch converter for Windows 95; it can be downloaded at <TT>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/webbrowsing/zippo</TT>.
(The <A HREF="script.html">zipped</A>
version of this paper</A> was prepared in this way.) </P>

<P>When rewriting is done by the content provider, the user does not need
to take any action to see the zipper-enhanced version of the document.
On the other hand, he can see the document in its original form only if
the content provider chooses to make it available. Thus, the user has maximum
convenience and transparency, but no control.</P>

<P> Alternatively, the user can be in control of the document transformation.
The prototypical mechanism for doing so is through a local proxy. This
approach gives the user the freedom to decide which pages should be zipped
up, at the cost of convenience (appropriate infrastructure must be installed).</P>

<P> Finally, the user could visit a &quot;zipping service&quot; Web site,
enter an arbitrary URL into a form, and get in return a zipped version
of the URL. This scenario is both convenient (there is no software to install)
and places the user in control, but it is not transparent because the returned
document shows the URL of the zipping service rather than that of the requested
page. Also, this approach is tedious since it requires the user to type
a URL. </P>

<H2><A NAME="discussion"></A>Discussion</H2>

<P>Zippers work well on Web pages that use heading tags to indicate the
logical structure of the page. Unfortunately, many authors use heading
tags to produce particular formatting effects, such as font and point size
changes, rather than to indicate logical structure. On such pages, users
can simply turn off the zippers and the page is displayed conventionally.</P>

<P> We know of one Web site that has hand-coded zippers <A HREF="#handcoded-zippers">[7]</A>.
The drawback of hand coding zippers is that it requires server interaction
to expand or contract, and an exponential number of files to capture all
states.</P>

<P> Authors of long pages frequently add a table of contents to the top
of the page, with entries in the table linking to the various sections.
Sometimes, each section appears on its own page, with &quot;next,&quot;
&quot;previous,&quot; &quot;up,&quot; and &quot;top&quot; links on each
page. Unfortunately, it is easy for the viewer to lose the big picture
because the table of contents is not visible while looking at the contents
of a particular section.</P>

<P> An alternative to zippers for retaining the big picture while viewing
the details is a multi-panel display, such as in SuperBook <A HREF="#superbook">[1]</A>.
One panel displays the table of contents and the other panel displays sections
in the document. Clicking on an entry in the table of contents causes the
other panel to display the corresponding part of the document. The user
can also open and close levels of the table of contents, but the body of
a section is always displayed in the second panel. A multi-panel display
such as SuperBook could be implemented using frames, by adding appropriate
HTML markups and scripting code to a source document.</P>

<P> Another related system is SoftQuad's Panorama Pro <A HREF="#panorama">[6]</A>,
which displays SGML documents using a two-panel viewer similar to that
of SuperBook. Panorama Pro is also loosely integrated with the Web: The
application can be configured as an external viewer of documents whose
MIME type is SGML. Clicking on a URL in a document displayed by Panorama
Pro will cause Netscape (or some other user-specified browser) to fetch
<I>and display</I> the URL. Electronic Book Technologies' DynaText <A HREF="#ebt">[4]</A>
is another impressive SGML viewer; it is integrated into Netscape as a
plug-in. It's important to realize, however, that Panorama Pro and DynaText
are not Web browsers.</P>

<H2><A NAME="conclusion"></A>Conclusion</H2>

<P>Viewing a Web page using zippers makes it possible to see details of
parts of the page while maintaining the global context of the entire page.
The larger the Web page - or the smaller the vertical space available for
the display - the more benefit there is to this technique. </P>

<P>Using the heading tags to infer a document's outline structure has two
limitations: First, as mentioned, content providers in practice often do
not use heading tags to indicate the logical structure of a document. Second,
content providers have no flexibility in the granularity of the material
being elided. Both of these limitations could be addressed by adding a
zipper tag to HTML. One possibility would be to parallel the DL, DT, and
DD tags: the ZL tag would introduce a series of zippers; the ZT tag would
be the heading of a zipper; and the ZD tag would be the body of the zipper.</P>

<P> Each of the implementations discussed in this paper has advantages
and drawbacks. The advantages of the custom browser approach are responsiveness,
ease of installation (there is no proxy to configure), and visual continuity
when clicking zippers. The drawback is that Web browsers are on a fast
evolutionary trajectory and browsers built in a research lab cannot keep
pace with the industry leaders. The advantage of the proxy approach is
that it interoperates with standard Web browsers; the drawbacks are visual
discontinuity when clicking a zipper, and some effort of configuring the
proxy. The advantage of using the script-based approach is that it works
with most standard Web browsers, and it allows content providers to prepare
documents which include zippers by default (without requiring any actions
from the user). The drawbacks are visual discontinuity when clicking a
zipper and (at least at the moment) efficiency issues.</P>
