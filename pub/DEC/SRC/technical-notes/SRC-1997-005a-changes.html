<H2>Changes included in SRC Technical Note 1997-005a</H2>

<P>The following list reflects the complete set of changes made to SRC
Technical Note
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/SRC-1997-005.html"
>1997-005</A> to produce the revised note
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/SRC-1997-005a.html"
>1997-005a</A>.</P>

<UL>
<LI>
An extra <CODE>fp_contents</CODE> argument has been added to the
<CODE>_run_tool</CODE> primitive. This argument allows the caller to
specify that the fingerprints of derived files should be computed from
the <I>contents</I> of the files. By default, a unique fingerprint is
chosen non-deterministically for each newly-created derived file.
<P>
<LI>
The way in which deleted files are handled in <CODE>_run_tool</CODE>
results has been changed. Deleted files are no longer removed from the
resulting binding, but are instead bound to the value <I>false</I>.
<P>
<LI>
New <CODE>_sub</CODE> functions have been defined on lists and
bindings. For consistency, the <CODE>_subtext</CODE> primitive
has been renamed <CODE>_sub</CODE>. Also, <CODE>_sub</CODE> has been
added to the list of reserved identifiers, and <CODE>_subtext</CODE>
has been removed from that list.
<P>
<LI>
The name <CODE>_map</CODE> has been added to the list of reserved
identifiers.
<P>
<LI>
A mistake in the grammar has been fixed: a hexadecimal Integer is
allowed to contain any number of hex digits, not at most two as in the
original grammar.
<P>
<LI>
Several minor typos have been corrected.
