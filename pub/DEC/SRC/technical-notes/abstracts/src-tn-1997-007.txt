When writing computer programs, programmers make assumptions about the
relations among variables.  In object-oriented programs, these
assumptions include relations among the instance variables of a single
object, relations often referred to as \emph{object invariants}.
It is a good idea to explicitly annotate a program with these
assumptions.  Then, a static program-analysis tool can inspect the
annotated program to check that routines preserve object invariants.
This paper considers two issues that affect what object invariants a
program analysis tool can check:  object construction and modular
checking. The paper suggests some programming idioms and program 
annotations that widen the range of object invariants that a static 
program checker can check.  The paper also suggests a simple extension 
to the Java programming language that makes the language more amenable to
object-invariant checking.
