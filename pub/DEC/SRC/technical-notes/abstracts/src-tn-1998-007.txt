Note #1998-007, March 18, 1998.

Authentication can serve both for assigning responsibility and for
giving credit. Some authentication protocols are adequate for one
purpose but not the other. This paper explains the distinction between
responsibility and credit, through several examples, and discusses the
role of this distinction in the design and analysis of protocols.
