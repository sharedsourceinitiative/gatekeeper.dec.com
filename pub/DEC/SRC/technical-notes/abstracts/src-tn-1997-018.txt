A reunion of people who worked on System R and its derivatives, 
including SQL/DS, DB2, and R*, was held at Asilomar on May 29, 
1995. This is an edited transcript of the day's discussions, 
incorporating changes provided by the speakers. It provides an 
informal but first-hand account of the birth of SQL, the history 
of System R, and the origins of a number of other relational 
systems inside and outside IBM.
