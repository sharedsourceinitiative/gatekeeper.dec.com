Coscheduling has been shown to be a critical factor in achieving
efficient parallel execution in timeshared environments.  However, the
most common approach, gang scheduling, has limitations in scaling, can
compromise good interactive response, and requires that communicating
processes be identified in advance.
<P>
We explore a technique called dynamic coscheduling (DCS) which
produces emergent coscheduling of the processes constituting a
parallel job.  Experiments are performed in a workstation environment
with high performance networks and autonomous timesharing schedulers
for each CPU.  The results demonstrate that DCS can achieve effective,
robust coscheduling for a range of workloads and background loads.
Empirical comparisons to implicit scheduling and uncoordinated
scheduling are presented.  Under spin-block synchronization, DCS
reduces job response times by up to 20% over implicit scheduling while
maintaining fairness; and under spinning synchronization, DCS reduces
job response times by up to two decimal orders of magnitude over
uncoordinated scheduling.  The results suggest that DCS is a promising
avenue for achieving coordinated parallel scheduling in an environment
that coexists with autonomous node schedulers.
