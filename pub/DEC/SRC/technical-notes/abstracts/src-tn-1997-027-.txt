This paper presents a simple and intuitive hypermedia synchronization
model -- the Media Relation Graph (MRG), and an alternative
implementation of the Hypermedia Presentation and Authoring System
(HPAS), which is the testbed for MRG. Our model combines the power of
both interval-based and point-based synchronization mechanisms. The
new implementation exploits many rich features of commercial web
browsers and reuses existing browser components, such as plugins and
Java applets.  (An overview of HPAS and its original Unix/C
implementation can be found here \cite{src-tn-1997-003}.)
