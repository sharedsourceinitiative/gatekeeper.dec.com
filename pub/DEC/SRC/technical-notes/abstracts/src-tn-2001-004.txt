"Selected 2001 SRC Summer Intern Reports"
Compiled by Cathy Miller
Note #2001-004, December 21, 2001. 

This document features informal reports by interns who spent the summer of 2001 working with researchers at Compaq Systems Research Center (SRC). The interns were graduate students in computer science or electrial engineering Ph.D. programs. Each worked for about three months at SRC, collaborating on a project with members of the research staff. The primary goal of this technical note is to describe the summer research projects. However, the interns were encouraged to write their reports in whatever format or style they preferred, so that non-technical observations (such as background and impressions arising from their stay) could also be included.
