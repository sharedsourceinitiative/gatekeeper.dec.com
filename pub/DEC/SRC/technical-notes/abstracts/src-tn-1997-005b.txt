Vesta-2 is a software configuration management system. Developers use
Vesta-2 to build and manage potentially large scale
software. The instructions for building a software artifact are written
in the Vesta-2 software description language (SDL). Evaluating a
Vesta-2 SDL program causes the artifact to be constructed. 

This note describes the syntax and semantics of the Vesta-2 SDL. It is a
reference manual for use by Vesta-2 users. The language is
functional, uses lexical scoping, and is dynamically typed. It includes
a single primitive function for invoking external tools like
compilers and linkers as function calls.
