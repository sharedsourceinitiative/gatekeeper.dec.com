We give short and simple proofs of the following two theorems
by Galil and Yu. Let s and t be two vertices in an n-node graph G.
(1) There exist k edge-disjoint s-t paths of total length
O(n k^{1/2). (2) If we additionally assume that the minimum degree of 
G is at least k, then there exist k edge-disjoint s-t paths, each of 
length O(n/k).
