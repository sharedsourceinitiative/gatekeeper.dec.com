This paper describes the Hypermedia Presentation and Authoring System
(HPAS), a Web browser with built-in authoring capabilities. In
contrast to traditional browsers, it manages time-based hypermedia
presentations and the associated dynamic spatial layout with respect
to time. The system manipulates various media types by embedding
object presenters, editors, and converters, which
combine to provide transparent operations on hypermedia
objects, such as MPEG videos, GIF images, rich text files, etc.
