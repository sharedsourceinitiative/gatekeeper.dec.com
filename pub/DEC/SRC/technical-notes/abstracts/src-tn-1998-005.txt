"Reduction in TLA"

Note #1998-005, March 10, 1998

Reduction theorems allow one to deduce properties of a concurrent
system specification from properties of a simpler, coarser-grained
version called the reduced specification.  We present reduction
theorems based upon a more precise relation between the original and
reduced specifications than earlier ones, permitting the use of
reduction to reason about a larger class of properties.  In
particular, we present reduction theorems that handle general 
liveness properties.
