We have developed an efficient way to determine the syntactic similarity
of files and have applied it to every document on the World Wide Web.
Using this mechanism, we built a clustering of all the documents that are
syntactically similar. Possible applications include a "Lost and Found"
service, filtering the results of Web searches, updating widely distributed
web-pages, and identifying violations of intellectual property rights.
