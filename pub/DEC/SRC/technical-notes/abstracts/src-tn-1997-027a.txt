This paper presents a simple and intuitive hypermedia synchronization
model -- the Media Relation Graph (MRG), and an alternative
implementation of the Hypermedia Presentation and Authoring System
(HPAS), which is the testbed for MRG. HPAS is a system for presenting,
integrating, and managing time-based hypermedia documents on the Web.
The underlying temporal model of HPAS combines the power of both
interval-based and point-based synchronization mechanisms. The new
Java-based implementation exploits many rich features of commercial
Web browsers and reuses existing browser components, such as plugins
and Java applets.  (An overview of HPAS and its original Unix/C
implementation can be found elsewhere \cite{src-tn-1997-003}.)
