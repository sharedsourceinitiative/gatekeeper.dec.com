In this paper we introduce a programming language for Web
document processing called WebL. WebL is a high level, object-oriented
scripting language that incorporates two novel features: service combinators
and a markup algebra. Service combinators are language constructs that
provide reliable access to web services by mimicking a web surfer's behavior
when a failure occurs while retrieving a page. The markup algebra extracts
structured and unstructured values from pages for computation, and is based
on algebraic operations on sets of markup elements. WebL is used to quickly
build and experiment with custom web crawlers, meta-search engines, page
transducers, shopping robots, etc.
