This document is an introduction to the syntax and semantics of the
operators of TLA+. It assumes that you are familiar with ordinary
mathematics (sets and functions) and are at least acquainted with TLA. It
should enable you to understand the expressions that appear in TLA+
specifications.

This is a preliminary document; suggestions are welcome.
