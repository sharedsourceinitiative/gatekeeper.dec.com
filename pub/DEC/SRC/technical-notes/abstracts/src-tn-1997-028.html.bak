Note #1997-028, November 1997.
<P>
This document features informal reports by interns who spent the
summer of 1997 working with researchers at DIGITAL Systems Research
Center (SRC).  The interns were graduate students in computer
science or electrial engineering Ph.D. programs.  Each worked for
about three months at SRC, collaborating on a project with
the research staff.  The primary goal of this technical note is to
describe the summer research projects.  However, the interns were
encouraged to write their reports in whatever format or style they
preferred, so that non-technical observations (such as background and
impressions arising from their stay) could also be included.
