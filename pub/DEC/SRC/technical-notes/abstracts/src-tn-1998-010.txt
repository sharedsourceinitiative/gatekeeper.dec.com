This paper studies the multicast routing and admission control problem
on unit-capacity tree and mesh topologies in the throughput-model.
The problem is a generalization of the edge-disjoint paths problem and
is NP-hard both on trees and meshes.

We study both the offline and the online version of the problem: In
the offline setting, we give the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for trees, and an O((log log n)^2)-factor approximation
algorithm for meshes.

In the online setting, we give the first polylogarithmic competitive
online algorithm for tree and mesh topologies.  No
polylogarithmic-competitive algorithm is possible on general network
topologies and there exists a polylogarithmic lower bound on the
competitive ratio of any online algorithm on tree topologies.  We
prove the same lower bound for meshes.
