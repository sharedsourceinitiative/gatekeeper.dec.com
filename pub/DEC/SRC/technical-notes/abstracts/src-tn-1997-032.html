A classic problem in security is the problem of determining whether 
a given program has <I>secure information flow</I>.  Informally, 
this problem may be described as follows:  Given a program operating 
on public and private variables, check whether observations of 
the public variables before and after execution reveal any information 
about the initial values of the private variables.  Although 
the problem has been studied for several decades, most of the 
previous approaches have been syntactic in nature, often using 
type systems and compiler data flow analysis techniques to analyze 
program texts.  This paper presents a considerably different 
approach to checking secure information flow, based on a semantic 
characterization of security.  A semantic approach has several 
desirable features.  Firstly, it gives a more precise characterization 
of security than that possible by conservative methods based 
on type systems.  Secondly, it applies to any programming constructs 
whose semantics are definable; for instance, nondeterminism and 
exceptions pose no additional problems.  Thirdly, it can be applied 
to reasoning about indirect leaking of information through variations 
in program behavior (<I>e.g.</I>, whether or not the program 
terminates).  The method is also useful in the context of automated 
verification, since it can be used to develop a mechanically-assisted 
technique for checking whether the flow of a given program is 
secure.
