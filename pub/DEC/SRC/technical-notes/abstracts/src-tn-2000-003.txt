A static program checker that performs modular checking can check
one program module for errors without needing to analyze the entire
program. Modular checking requires that each module be accompa-nied
by annotations that specify the module. To help reduce the cost of
writing specifications, this paper presents Houdini, an annotation as-sistant
for the modular checker ESC/Java. To infer suitable ESC/Java
annotations for a given program, Houdini generates a large number of
candidate annotations and uses ESC/Java to verify or refute each of
these annotations. The paper describes the design, implementation,
and preliminary evaluation of Houdini.
