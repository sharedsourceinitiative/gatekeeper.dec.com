We present the first polylog-competitive online algorithm for the
general multicast problem in the throughput model.  The ratio of the
number of requests accepted by the optimum offline algorithm to the
expected number of requests accepted by our algorithm is O(log M
(log n+log log M)log n), where M is the number of multicast groups and
n is the number of nodes in the graph. We show that this is close to
optimum by presenting an Omega(log n log M) lower bound on this ratio
for any randomized online algorithm against an oblivious adversary,
when M is much larger than the link capacities. We also show that it
is impossible to be competitive against an adaptive online adversary.

As in the previous online routing algorithms, our algorithm uses edge-costs
when deciding on which is the best path to use. In contrast to the previous
competitive algorithms in the throughput model, our cost is not a direct
function of the edge load. The new cost definition allows us to decouple the
effects of routing and admission decisions of different multicast groups.
