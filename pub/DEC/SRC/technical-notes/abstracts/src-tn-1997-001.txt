In object-oriented programs built in layers, an object at a higher
level of abstraction is implemented by objects at lower levels of
abstraction. It is usually crucial to correctness that a lower-level 
object not be shared among several higher-level objects. This paper 
unveils some difficulties in writing procedure specifications strong 
enough to guarantee that a lower-level object can be used in the 
implementation of another object at a higher level of abstraction.
To overcome these difficulties, the paper presents "virginity",
a convenient way of specifying that an object is not globally
reachable and thus can safely be used in the implementation of a
higher-level abstraction.
