"Variations on a Theme by Chuck Thacker: Hypercube Routing with Limited Interconnections"
Andrei Broder, Mark Manasse, Jim Saxe
Note #2000-001. January 6, 2000.

In a recent talk at SRC, Chuck Thacker (Microsoft Corporation) described 
a routing scheme for a small hypercube network. In this note we explore 
some generalizations of Chuck's ideas and offer a routing
scheme in arbitrary dimensional hypercubes. We also provide a
lower-bound counterexample to fault-tolerance.
