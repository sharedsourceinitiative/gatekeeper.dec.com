Note #1998-017. December 11, 1998.

We analyze low density parity check codes that correct both
errors and erasures using a simple decoding scheme. Our framework 
unifies previous analyses for low density parity check codes
and erasure codes. The result is a general class of codes that 
corrects both errors and erasures, with corresponding simple 
linear time encoding and decoding algorithms and provable 
performance guarantees. We also describe how these codes can 
be applied to yield a new fast algorithm for the setting of 
Gaussian noise, and leave several open questions regarding the 
construction of these codes and the associated decoding algorithms.
