We consider the problem of load balancing in dynamic distributed
systems in cases where new incoming tasks can make use of old
information.  For example, consider a multi-processor system where
incoming tasks with exponentially distributed service requirements
arrive as a Poisson process, the tasks must choose a processor for
service, and a task knows when making this choice the processor loads
from T seconds ago.  What is a good strategy for choosing a
processor, in order for tasks to minimize their expected time in the
system?  Such models can also be used to describe settings where there
is a transfer delay between the time a task enters a system and the
time it reaches a processor for service.
<P>
Our models are based on considering the behavior of limiting systems
where the number of processors goes to infinity.  The limiting systems
can be shown to accurately describe the behavior of sufficiently large
systems, and simulations demonstrate that they are reasonably accurate
even for systems with a small number of processors.  Our studies of
specific models demonstrate the importance of using randomness to
break symmetry in these systems and yield important rules of thumb for
system design.  The most significant result is that only small amounts
of load information can be extremely useful in these settings; for
example, having incoming tasks choose the least loaded of two randomly
chosen processors is extremely effective over a large range of
possible system parameters.  In contrast, using global information can
actually degrade performance unless used correctly; for
example, unlike most settings where the load information is current,
having tasks go to the least loaded server can significantly hurt
performance.
