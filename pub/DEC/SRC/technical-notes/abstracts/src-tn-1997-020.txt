We present fully dynamic algorithms for maintaining the biconnected
components in general and plane graphs.

A fully dynamic algorithm maintains a graph during a sequence of
insertions and deletions of edges or isolated vertices.  Let m be the
number of edges and n be the number of vertices in a graph.  The time
per operation of the previously best deterministic algorithms were
O(min {m^{2/3},n}) in general graphs and
O(sqrt n) in plane graphs for fully dynamic biconnectivity. We improve
these running times to O(sqrt(m) log n) in general graphs and
O(log ^2 n) in plane graphs.  Our algorithm for general graphs can
also find the biconnected components of all vertices in time O(n).
