The Compaq Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java) is a programming tool that attempts to find common 
run-time errors in Java programs by static analysis of the program text. Users can control the amount and kinds of 
checking that ESC/Java performs by annotating their program with specially formatted comments called pragmas. 
This manual is designed to serve both as an introduction to ESC/Java and as a reference manual. It starts by providing 
an overview of ESC/Java through an illustrative example of its use and a summary of its features, and then goes on to 
document all the pragmas supported by ESC/Java and all the kinds of warnings that it generates. Appendices provide 
a brief sketch of ESC/Java's implementation, information about obtaining ESC/Java, and some discussion of its limitations.
