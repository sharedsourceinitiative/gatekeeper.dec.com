"Mobile Ambient Synchronization"
Luca Cardelli
Note #1997-013. July 10, 1997.

This note describes a non-distributed implementation of the 
basic operations of the Ambient Calculus, which is a calculus 
for mobile computing developed together with Andrew Gordon. The 
implementation uses standard shared-memory concurrent programming 
technology in the form provided by Java. The presentation is 
self-contained, but previous familiarity with the Ambient Calculus 
is useful for motivation and intuitions.
