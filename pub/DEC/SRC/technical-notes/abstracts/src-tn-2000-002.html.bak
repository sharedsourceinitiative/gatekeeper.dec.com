Note #2000-002, October 12, 2000.
<p>The Compaq Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java) is a programming
tool that attempts to find common run-time errors in Java programs by static
analysis of the program text. Users can control the amount and kinds of
checking that ESC/Java performs by annotating their programs with specially
formatted comments called pragmas. This manual is designed to serve both
as an introduction to ESC/Java and as a reference manual. It starts by
providing an overview of ESC/Java through an illustrative example of its
use and a summary of its features, and then goes on to document all the
pragmas supported by ESC/Java and all the kinds of warnings that it generates.
Appendices provide a brief sketch of ESC/Java's implementation, information
about obtaining ESC/Java, and some discussion of its limitations.
