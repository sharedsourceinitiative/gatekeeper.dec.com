In this paper we study the space requirement of algorithms that 
make only one (or a small number of) pass(es) over the input data.
We study such algorithms under a model of data streams that we introduce 
here. We give a number of upper and lower bounds for problems stemming 
from query-processing, invoking in the process tools from the area of
communication complexity.
