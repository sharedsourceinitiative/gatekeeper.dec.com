"Substitution: Syntactic versus Semantic"
Leslie Lamport
Note #1998-004, March 11, 1998

A formalism with quantifiers permits two kinds of substitution:
syntactic substitution that allows the capture of bound variables and
semantic substitution that does not.  When quantification is explicit,
all substitution can be made semantic.  When quantification is
implicit, as in some formalisms used to reason about programs, both
types of substitution are needed.
