Concurrent programs can suffer from many types of errors, not just the well-studied problems of deadlocks and simple race conditions on variables.  This paper addresses a kind of race condition that arises from reading a variable whose value is possibly out-of-date. The paper introduces a simple technique for detecting such stale values, and reports on the encouraging experience with a compile-time checker that uses the technique.
