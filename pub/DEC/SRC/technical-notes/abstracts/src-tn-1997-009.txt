"Juno-2 Language Definition"
Greg Nelson and Allan Heydon
Note #1997-009. June 30, 1997. 15 pages.

Juno-2 is a constraint-based language intended for graphics
applications. A Juno-2 program describes a picture; a Juno-2
implementation renders the picture. The paper describes the syntax
and semantics of the Juno-2 language.

The Juno-2 language is useful for drawing pictures, and also
interesting for its simplicity, uniformity, and its provisions
for solving constraints. We hope the paper will be useful to Juno-2
users, and also of interest to programming language users and
designers.
