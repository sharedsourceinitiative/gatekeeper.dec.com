"Studying Balanced Allocations with Differential Equations"

Using differential equations, we examine the GREEDY algorithm studied
by Azar, Broder, Karlin, and Upfal for distributed load
balancing. This approach yields accurate estimates of the actual load
distribution, provides insight into the exponential improvement GREEDY
offers over simple random selection, and allows one to prove tight
concentration theorems about the loads in a straightforward manner.
