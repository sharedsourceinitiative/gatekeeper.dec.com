This paper describes the DIGITAL Continuous Profiling Infrastructure,
a sampling-based profiling system designed to run continuously on
production systems.  The system supports multiprocessors, works on
unmodified executables, and collects profiles for entire systems,
including user programs, shared libraries, and the operating system
kernel.  Samples are collected at a high rate (over 5200 samples/sec
per 333-MHz processor), yet with low overhead (1-3% slowdown
for most workloads).

Analysis tools supplied with the profiling system use the sample data
to produce a precise and accurate accounting, down to the level of pipeline
stalls incurred by individual instructions, of where time is being
spent.  When instructions incur stalls, the tools identify possible
reasons, such as cache misses, branch mispredictions, and functional
unit contention.  The fine-grained instruction-level analysis guides
users and automated optimizers to the causes of performance problems
and provides important insights for fixing them.
