"Maintaining Minimum Spanning Trees in Dynamic Graphs"

Note #1997-019. September 5, 1997.

We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a minimum
spanning tree in time o(sqrt n) per operation.  To be precise, the
algorithm uses O(n^{1/3} log n) amortized time per update operation.
The algorithm is fairly simple and deterministic.  An immediate
consequence is the first fully dynamic deterministic algorithm for
maintaining connectivity and, bipartiteness in amortized time
O(n^{1/3} log n) per update, with O(1) worst case time per query.
