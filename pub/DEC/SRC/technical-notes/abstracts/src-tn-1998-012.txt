"Firelink: A Reconfigurable Firewire Testbed"

Note #1998-012, June 1, 1998.

We describe the design and implementation of a reconfigurable 
high-speed interface for IEEE 1394 Firewire and measurements 
obtained with this system. For the physical and link layers we 
use a commercial chip-set. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays on 
the PCI Pamette and a secondary FireLink board are used to 
implement a simple transaction layer interfacing the link 
layers to the host CPU.
