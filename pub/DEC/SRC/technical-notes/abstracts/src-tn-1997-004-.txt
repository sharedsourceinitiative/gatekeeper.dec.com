This paper presents the first dynamic algorithm that maintains 2-edge
connectivity in polylogarithmic time per operation.  The algorithm is
a Las-Vegas type randomized algorithm.

For a sequence of Omega(m_0) operations, where m_0 is the number of
edges in the initial graph, the expected time for p insertions or
deletions of edges is O(p log^5n) and the worst-case time for a query
is O(log n).  If only deletions are allowed then the cost for p
updates is O(p log^4n) expected time.
