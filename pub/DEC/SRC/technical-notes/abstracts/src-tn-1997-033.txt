Despite their notorious vulnerability, traditional passwords remain 
important for security. In this paper we describe a method for 
strengthening passwords. Our method does not require users to memorize 
or to write down long passwords, and does not rely on smart-cards or 
other auxiliary hardware. The main cost of our method is that it lengthens 
the process of checking a password.
