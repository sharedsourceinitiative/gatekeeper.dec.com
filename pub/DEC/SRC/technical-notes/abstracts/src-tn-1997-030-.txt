"Composition: A Way to Make Proofs Harder"
Leslie Lamport
Note #1997-030. December 9, 1997.

Compositional reasoning about a system means writing its specification
as the parallel composition of components and reasoning separately
about each component.  When distracting language issues are removed
and the underlying mathematics is revealed, compositional reasoning is
seen to be of little use.
