In this paper we present an analysis of a 280 GB AltaVista Search Engine
query log consisting of approximately 1 billion entries for search
requests over a period of six weeks.  This represents approximately
285 million user sessions, each an attempt to fill a single information
need.

We present an analysis of individual queries, query duplication, and
query sessions.  Furthermore we present results of a correlation
analysis of the log entries, studying the interaction of terms within
queries.

Our data supports the conjecture that web users differ significantly
from the user assumed in the standard information retrieval
literature.  Specifically, we show that web users type in short
queries, mostly look at the first 10 results only, and seldom
modify the query.  This suggests that traditional information retrieval
techniques might not work well for answering web search requests.

The correlation analysis showed that the
most highly correlated items are constituents of phrases.  This result
indicates it may be useful for search engines to consider search terms
as parts of phrases even if the user did not explicitly specify them
as such.
