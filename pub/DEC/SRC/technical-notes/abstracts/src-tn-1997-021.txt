In this paper, we present sparse certificates for
biconnectivity together with algorithms for updating these
certificates.  We thus obtain fully-dynamic algorithms for
biconnectivity in graphs that run in O(sqrt n log n log (m/n))
amortized time per operation, where m is the number of edges and n is
the number of nodes in the graph.  This improves upon the results in
the paper "Improved Data Structures for Fully Dynamic Biconnectivity" 
(M. H. Rauch, Proc. 26th Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing) in 
which algorithms were presented running in O(sqrt m log
n) amortized time, and solves the open problem to find certificates to
speed up biconnectivity, as stated in "Sparsification - A technique for 
speeding up dynamic graph algorithms," (D. Eppstein et al. Proc. 33nd
Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science}, 1992).
