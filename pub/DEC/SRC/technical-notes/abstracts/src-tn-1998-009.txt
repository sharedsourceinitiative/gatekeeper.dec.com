We construct new families of error-correcting codes based on
Gallager's low-density parity-check codes, which we call irregular 
codes. When decoded using belief propagation, our codes can correct 
more errors than previously known low-density parity-check codes.
For example, for rate 1/4 codes on 16,000 bits over a binary symmetric 
channel, previous low-density parity-check codes can correct up to 
approximately 16% errors, while our codes can correct over 17%. Our 
improved performance comes from using codes based on irregular
random bipartite graphs. Previously studied low-density parity-check 
codes have been derived from regular bipartite graphs. We report 
experimental results for our irregular codes on both binary symmetric 
channels and Gaussian channels. In some cases our results come very 
close to reported results for turbo codes, suggesting that, with 
improvements, irregular codes may be able to match turbo code 
performance.
