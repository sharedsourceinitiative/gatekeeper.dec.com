<td><b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>Multithreaded software systems are susceptible to a wide range of errors.
Many of these errors are synchronization errors arising from data races,
i.e., when two threads access or update the same memory location at the
same time. To avoid this, programmers place restrictions on when shared
locations can be read or written. The most common way of avoiding data
races is to associate locks with shared data. However, in practice there
can be many different kinds of locking disciplines, and sometimes, correct
access may be guaranteed by other techniques, such as temporal separation
of accesses. In addition, it is often desirable to check invariants on
shared data.&nbsp;
<p>Many techniques have been devised for checking multithreaded programs
for simple locking disciplines. However, more complicated ways of avoiding
data races cannot be easily handled. Thread-modular verification(TMV) <a href="#tmv">[2]</a>
addresses this problem. TMV is a technique for verifying synchronization
properties of multithreaded programs without procedures. It works by analyzing
one thread at a time, using assumptions on other threads in the environment.
Techniques and tools for verifying sequential programs, such as ESC/Java<a href="#esc">[1]</a>,
can then be leveraged.&nbsp;
<p>To make TMV useful, one needs to add to it the ability to reason about
procedures in a modular manner. Procedure-modular verification is a technique
for verifying sequential programs with procedures, one procedure at a time,
by using precondition/postcondition specifications at call sites. The goal
of our work, then, is to combine the above methods to achieve modular verification
of multithreaded programs with procedures. We realized that precondition/postcondition
specifications for procedures do not suffice for modular verification in
the presence of multiple threads. To overcome this problem, we propose
a new procedure specification that overcomes some of the problems with
precondition/postcondition specifications.&nbsp;
<p><b>2. Insufficiency of pre/post conditions</b>
<p>Consider a concurrent program with a single shared variable x. This program uses
a readers-writer (shared-exclusive) lock rwl to mediate access to x. Suppose
that we want x to obey the invariant that it is always positive when no thread holds
rwl in write mode. A fragment of Java code for this program is shown below with
ESC/Java style annotations(the "run" method is executed by the thread that
is being analyzed):&nbsp;
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ReadersWriterLock rwl;
&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ global_invariant !rwl.hasWriter ==> (x > 0) */

&nbsp;&nbsp; void run() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rwl.beginRead();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x++;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert(x > 1);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rwl.endRead();
&nbsp;&nbsp; }

</pre>
One can convince oneself that the assert enclosed within the beginRead()
and endRead() combination should pass. However, we are unable to show
this using just pre and post conditions of beginRead(). The pre/post
condition specification of beginRead() is shown below:&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ ensures isReader[currentThread] &amp;&amp; !hasWriter */
&nbsp;&nbsp; void beginRead() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* body */
&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
Notice that we cannot state anything stronger about the post-condition.
In particular, we would like to strengthen the post-condition with "x>0",
but we cannot because x is only in scope in the client code for the readers-writer
lock and not in the code for the lock itself. In fact, different clients
might need different, possibly contradictory, ways of strengthening the
post-conditions.&nbsp;
<p><b>3. Atomic specifications of procedures</b>
<p>The fundamental problem described in the previous section (with using
pre and post conditions) is that the specification we need is one which
captures the atomic transition within beginRead() from the point when there
is no writer to the point where the thread executing beginRead() atomically
gets the read lock. We call this more precise specification as a "atomic
specification" (also called a "performs" specification in our implementation).&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ performs (isReader[currentThread])&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { \old(!hasWriter) &amp;&amp; isReader[currentThread] } */
&nbsp;&nbsp; void beginRead() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* body */
&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
The meaning of a "performs (v) {P}" specification is that atomically, on
some transition in the procedure whose pre-state is governed by P, the
thread executing the procedure changes the value of v according to P. The
thread executing the procedure leaves v unchanged at all other points.&nbsp;
<p>Given the "performs" specification of beginRead(), we can now use it
at the call site to reason that the assert passes. To see this, notice
that in the pre-state of the atomic action, !hasWriter is true. In addition,
the invariant holds at this point. These two facts imply that x > 0. The
predicate x > 0 continues to be true until the end of beginRead() and hence
we can conclude that the assert passes.&nbsp;
<p>The performs specification must also be checked on the method implementation.
We do this using a monitoring state machine.&nbsp;
<p><b>4. Implementation</b>
<p>We have extended ESC/Java to do thread-modular verification and to reason
about procedures with atomic specifications. The major changes we made
to ESC/Java were in generating and placing code that models actions by
the environment (constrained by TMV assumptions), code to check for TMV
guarantees, and code to check for "performs" specifications. We took an
atomic block of statements executed by a thread to be one in which only
one read or write to a word-sized shared data location occurs. We model
actions by other threads as occuring between atomic blocks; these actions
can modify shared state only in a way that is consistent with environment
assumptions of the thread being analyzed.&nbsp;
<p><b>5. Experimental Results</b>
<p>We ran the modified version of ESC/Java on several examples. The largest
example was the part of the Mercator Web crawler <a href="#mercator">[3]</a>
that deals with readers-writer locks. This code comprises about 1500 lines
of Java source code, and we checked it for violations of constraints on
writing shared data, and for a few data invariants. We did not find any
bugs in Mercator, but we did find a known bug in java.util.Vector.&nbsp;
<p>We also studied the annotation overhead in using TMV. We took the rather
non-modular, but low-annotation-overhead, approach of inlining all non-public
methods, and checking specifications only of interfaces (viz. public methods
and fields). Even with the blow-up in the size of methods from inlining,
ESC/Java and Simplify scaled well: for example, checks for all but two
methods in Mercator took less than 10 minutes.&nbsp;
<p><b>6. Conclusions and Future Work</b>
<p>Our initial experiments indicate that thread-modular verification extended
with atomic specifications for procedures is a useful technique to check
general synchronization properties and data invariants. The tool we built
for Java has scaled well to work on real programs. Annotations tend to
concentrate at the interfaces; if there is much interface reuse then the
cost of adding annotations at the interface can be amortized over several
uses.&nbsp;
<p>There are many avenues for future work. We are currently working on
safe optimizations to reduce the checking code and the number of places
we have to insert checks; some of these have already been implemented.
Reducing the annotation burden by infering "boilerplate" annotations (such
as those for simple locks) can be added; more complicated annotation inference
remains a challenge. Finally, exploring richer method specifications provides
many avenues for further work.&nbsp;
