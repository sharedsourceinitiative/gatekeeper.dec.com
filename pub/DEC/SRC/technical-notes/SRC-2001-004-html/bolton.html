<td><b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>
This summer I spent a very enjoyable three and a half months at SRC.
Greg Nelson, my host, and I built Typsy, a type-based tool for java
programmers.

<p>
Java programmers using unfamiliar packages often need to spend a
significant amount of time searching for methods or procedures to
perform routine tasks.  This search time is spent reading the
documentation, thumbing through indexes and grepping through interface
files.  Our goal for the summer was to build a tool to eliminate or
greatly reduce this search time.

The idea is that even if the programmer doesn't know the name of the
method they probably know something about its argument types and
result type.  This suggests a search tool that accepts both the
signature of the method and a context specifying the relevant
libraries.  It then returns a list of combinations of methods, fields
and constructors with the correct signature.

<td><b>2. Example</b>
<p>

An example of when the tool might be used arose during its
construction.  We wished to extract the first word from a stream of
input.  Had we already built the tool our query would have been as
follows: our goal type is a string; our given argument is an input
stream that we shall call ``in''; and our context is the
<em>java.io</em> package.  The tool comes up with a list of
type-correct suggestions each with hyper-text links to the java
documentation.  These suggestions use combinations of methods, fields
and constructors.  The fifth suggestion, the procedure that we were
looking for, proposes that we construct a <em>StreamTokenizer</em>
with our given <em>InputStream</em>, <em>in</em>, as its argument, and
then call the <em>sval</em> field on the StreamTokenizer.
<blockquote> <em> (new java.io.StreamTokenizer(java.io.InputStream
in)).sval </em>
</blockquote>

<td><b>3. Outline of project</b>
		<p> Our initial step was a feasibility study: could we build a tool that 
		  produced a <em>single</em> smallest term of the correct type? We were 
		  able to use an in-house package, built as part of <a
href="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/abstracts/src-tn-2000-002.html">ESC/Java</a>, 
		  to extract the methods, fields, constructors and supertypes of classes 
		  from their java source files. We defined a cost function as a measure 
		  of the size of each term and then applied an algorithm based on Knuth's 
		  generalization of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Our tool then 
		  identified a minimal-cost term of the correct type. Having completed 
		  our feasibility study and established that it was possible to extract 
		  a single minimal cost term of our desired goal type, the next step was 
		  to extend this to finding, say twenty smallest cost terms. We decided 
		  to adopt a breadth-first search approach. 
		<p>
For each query, the tool constructs a tree with the desired goal type
as its root node and with each layer containing any types that might
be directly used in the construction of a type in the layer above.
The tree is <em>pruned</em> so that the bottom layer contains only
given arguments and every other layer contains only those types that
can be constructed from the types remaining in the layer below.

Various dynamic adjustment heuristics are applied to ensure an
appropriate number of suggestions.  If there are too few suggestions
then a few basic types such as <em>boolean</em> and <em>integer</em>
may be included in suggested procedures.  If there are too many
suggestions we <em>snip</em> and <em>flag</em>: we snip the tree at
any nodes with too many children and flag the fact that we have done
this in our list of suggestions.  It is then up to the user to
investigate this branch further if they believe that that is where
their solution lies.

<p>
We gave Typsy an html interface with hyper-links from the methods,
fields and constructors included in suggested procedures to Sun's java
documentation.  We used perl cgi-script to provide the link between
the interface and the tool.
