<td><b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>

Speculative execution is a technique for prefetching
disk blocks before they are required, by pre-executing 
application code whenever the CPU is idle. Disk requests
found by speculative execution are turned into prefetches.
The original SpecHint tool, written by Fay Chang, was implemented
entirely within user space. Although it was effective
for many benchmarks, it is hard to control resource
utilisation without assistance from the operating system.
This means that SpecHint can harm application performance
if, for example, memory is scarce.
<p>
My work this summer explored the potential advantages of removing this
constraint by  
implementing and evaluating a design that includes special operating system 
support for the speculative execution approach.  Somewhat to our surprise, 
our results indicate that allowing such support will not produce larger 
performance improvements.  Nevertheless, where adding such support is
feasible, our new design has improved resource control which makes it
a more practical alternative to SpecHint.

<td><b>2. Design overview</b>
<p>

Each time a new process is created, an additional process is also
forked and marked as the <em>shadow</em> of the primary process. The
shadow exists for the entire lifetime of its parent, and
remains idle until the primary process requests a file region which
must be fetched from disk. At that point the shadow is synchronized
by copying the primary process's memory and file tables, and becomes
runnable.
<p>
We take particular care when allocating shared resources to a shadow
process to ensure that this does not impact the performance of
higher-priority operations. Critical resources which we consider are
processing time, memory, and disk bandwidth. 
<p>
The most difficult resource to control is memory, because it is
generally impossible to allocate a memory page to a shadow process
without evicting pages which may be more valuable. It is common
practice to allocate most of physical memory to either file cache or
application virtual memory. Only a small number of pages will
typically be available for immediate allocation, and a kernel daemon
will periodically run to keep the free list `topped up'. A page
allocated to a shadow process may therefore cause another page to be
evicted at some later time, when the reclaim daemon runs, but it 
is impossible to determine that page's value, or even which page
it will be. We implement a simple scheme in which shadow pages are
initially allocated onto a low-priority page list, thus making them
good candidates for eviction, and by preventing shadow processes from
marking pages as referenced. Our intention is that high memory demands
by a shadow process will cause its own pages, or pages from another
shadow process, to be evicted before those of a primary process.

<td><b>3. Results</b>
<p>

We implemented our design within Linux 2.4.8, and evaluated it
using a range of disk-intensive applications. These included
<p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Gnuld</em>: object code linker
<li> <em>Agrep</em>: text-file pattern matching
<li> <em>XDataSlice</em>: three-dimensional data visualization
<li> <em>PostgresQL</em>: flexible DBMS, based on POSTGRES 
<li> <em>Sphinx</em>: speech-recognition system
</ul>
<p>
Our experiments were conducted on an
866MHz Pentium III with 128MB of memory, running our modified kernel.
The test filesystem system consisted of four Compaq RZ1CB Ultra SCSI
discs (12ms average seek time) striped into a 16GB array. The maximum
transfer rate supported by the discs and the SCSI interface was
40MB/s. 
<p>
With 128MB of memory, which was more than adequate for the
benchmarks we used, the performance improvements were similar to
those achieved by the original SpecHint tool.
<p>
When memory was reduced to 64MB, we were able to prevent speculative
execution from significantly reducing performance on those benchmarks
which required a large amount of memory (for example, Sphinx).
