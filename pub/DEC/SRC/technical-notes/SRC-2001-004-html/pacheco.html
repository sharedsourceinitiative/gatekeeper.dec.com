<td><b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>

Reasoning in TLA [5] consists largely of reasoning about actions.  By
most accounts, 90% of all reasoning in TLA+ specifications [4] occurs
at the action level, where temporal logic has been eliminated. Action
reasoning alone, for example, is involved in all but the last step of
establishing an invariant of a specification. Consider a system with
starting state <i>Init</i> and next-state relation <i>Next</i>. In
order to establish an invariant <i>Inv</i> of the system, we need two
lemmas:<p>


1. <i>Init => Inv </i><br> 2. <i>Inv /\ Next => Inv'</i><p>


Once we establish these two lemmas, one application of a TLA inference
rule, along with simple temporal reasoning, lets us establish the
invariant at the temporal level (the formula []<i>Inv</i>). In the
Disk Synod algorithm [1], establishing []<i>Inv</i> from formulas like
(1) and (2) above takes up one page, while the creation of an
invariant and its verification at the action level spans 18 pages.<p>

Our goal is to provide mechanical support for proving TLA+ invariants
at the action level. A system that deals effectively with action-level
formulas would take us a long way in mechanically checking the
correctness of specifications.<p>

Our platform of choice for mechanical verification is <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2">ACL2</a> [1].  The
ACL2 system is attractive for several reasons. It is among the most
automated in the spectrum of theorem provers. It blends arithmetic
decision procedures with rewriting techniques. Finally, it is a stable
and robust system, designed to tackle industrial-size verification
projects.<p>


<b>2. A Mechanical Translator</b><p>

A first experiment at the University of Texas at Austin [7] consisted
in manually translating the Disk Synod algorithm into ACL2 and
verifying two invariants of the algorithm. The goal of the summer
project was to automate the translation. We wrote a proof-of-concept
TLA/ACL2 mechanical translator. The translation scheme is largely
based on ACL2's finite set theory [6].  Note the keyword <i>finite</i>
in the previous sentence: the translator handles a subset of TLA+
concepts, and infinite sets are not allowed.<p>

Our translator not only translates TLA+ specifications, but also
<i>structured proofs</i> [3] of conjectures about the
specifications. In writing a structured proof, we mark some reasoning
steps as ``checked by ACL2'' and leave others unmarked (Figure 1). We
use ACL2 to check only those steps marked as ACL2 steps. The idea is
that, short of mechanically verifying every step of a proof, a user
might first want to explore pieces of a proof that are not entirely
clear or where he lacks confidence. Also, we want to use ACL2 only on
steps where it is appropriate to use ACL2: low-level, quantifier-free
formulas.<p>

<b>3. Results</b><p>

Our translator handled the entire TLA+ specification of Disk Synod and
two structured proofs of invariants of the algorithm (invariants
<i>I2a</i> and <i>I2c</i> in the Disk Paxos paper [1]). We used ACL2
to check most steps of these invariants. The few steps we avoided were
obviously correct high-level steps such as step <1>8 in Figure 1
above, whose correctness follows by the fact that steps <1>1 through
<1>7 (not shown in detail in Figure 1) establish the invariant for
every disjunct of <i>HNext</i>, the next-state action.<p>

Our effort led us to discover some needed hypotheses that were absent
in the original structured proofs.<p>

<b>4. Conclusion</b><p>

ACL2 is a general-purpose theorem prover, and one can use it to verify
every step of a proof in almost any mathematical domain, from real
analysis to circuit design. In our first experiments, we used ACL2 to
verify every step in the proofs of <i>I2a</i> and <i>I2c</i>. More
than half our time was spent trying to reason about simple steps in
higher-level concepts like quantification.  The main drawback in using
ACL2 is the different levels of abstraction at which TLA+ and ACL2
users commonly operate. ACL2 theories are usually fairly low-level,
concrete and computational.  On the other hand, TLA+ specifications
tend to be more descriptive than constructive, and make liberal use of
higher-level concepts which are difficult to handle in ACL2's
first-order, essentially quantifier-free logic.<p>


Our second approach was to use ACL2 only where it might be
suitable--closer to the leaves of a proof, where quantification has
been eliminated and all that remains are large but low-level
formulas. Although low-level, these formulas are nontrivial and can
be a challenge for any theorem prover. Moreover, it is most often in
these elaborate steps where errors are uncovered. It is to ACL2's
credit that it did so much work with little guidance. At the correct
level of abstraction, the prover not only helped us verify statements,
but it also pointed the way to omissions and errors with remarkable
precision.<p>

In further work, we would continue focusing ACL2's attention on
low-level segments of TLA+ proofs, refining our tools and lemma
libraries to increase the prover's power in this restricted
domain. For the remaining high-level steps of TLA+ proofs, we might
recruit a different theorem prover with a logic more expressive than
ACL2's. A future proof checker for TLA+ might, in addition to steps
labeled ``checked by ACL2,'' also have steps labeled ``checked by
<i>X</i>'' where <i>X</i> is a different theorem prover. The framework
for structured proofs we have followed allows for collaboration among
multiple provers (each with its own particular strengths) in attacking
a verification project.<p>
