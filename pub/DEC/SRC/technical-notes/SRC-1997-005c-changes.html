<H2>Changes included in SRC Technical Note 1997-005c</H2>

<P>The following list reflects the complete set of changes made to SRC
Technical Note
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/SRC-1997-005b.html"
>1997-005b</A> to produce the revised note
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/SRC-1997-005c.html"
>1997-005c</A>.</P>

<UL>

<LI>The optional argument <I>existing_writable</I> is added to the
signature of _run_tool.  For backward compatibility, the new argument
is last and its default value is FALSE, so old models have the same
semantics as before the language change.

<P><LI>A paragraph is added to clarify that modification of
preexisting files by a tool (when permitted) is handled in the same
way as creation of new files.

<P><LI>The _run_tool argument <I>fp_contents</I> is changed from type
t_boolean to type t_int.  For backward compatibility, boolean values
are accepted and translated into appropriate integer values.

<P><LI>Documentation of _par_map(t_closure f, t_binding b) is added.
It was omitted by mistake in the previous revision.

<P><LI>Minor HTML formatting bugs are corrected.
