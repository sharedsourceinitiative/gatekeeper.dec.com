We would like to thank Mike Burrows, Allan Heydon, Hal Murray, Sharon
Perl, and Sharon Smith for helpful comments that greatly improved the
content and presentation of this paper.  We would also like to thank
Dawson Engler for initially suggesting the use of inter-processor
interrupts to avoid expensive synchronization operations in the
interrupt handler, Mitch Lichtenberg for his work on the Alpha/NT
version of our system and in general for his help and suggestions on
the project, and the developers of iprobe for supplying us with source
code that helped us get off the ground in building the early versions
of our data collection system.  Finally, we would like to thank Gary
Carleton of Intel for answering our questions about Vtune and Marty
Itzkowitz of SGI for answering our questions about SpeedShop.
