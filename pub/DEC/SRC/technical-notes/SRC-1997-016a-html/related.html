Few other profiling systems can monitor complete system activity with
high-frequency sampling and low overhead; only ours and
<I>Morph</I><A HREF="references.html#Zha97">[Zha97]</A>
are designed to run continuously for long
periods on production systems, something that is essential for
obtaining useful profiles of large complex applications such as
databases.  In addition, we know of no other system that can analyze
time-biased samples to produce accurate fine-grained information about
the number of cycles taken by each instruction and the reasons for
stalls; the only other tools that can produce similar information use
simulators, at much higher cost.
</P>

Table 1 below compares several profiling systems.
The <I>overhead</I> column describes how much profiling slows down
the target program; low overhead is defined arbitrarily as less than
20%.  The <I>scope</I> column shows whether the profiling
system is restricted to a single application (App) or can measure full
system activity (Sys).  The <I>grain</I> column indicates the range
over which an individual measurement applies.  For example, <I>gprof</I>
counts procedure executions, whereas <I>pixie</I> can count executions of
each instruction.  <I>Prof</I> goes even further and reports the time spent
executing each instruction, which, given the wide variations in
latencies of different instructions, is often more useful than just an
execution count.  The <I>stalls</I> column indicates whether and how
well the system can subdivide the time spent at an instruction into
components like cache miss latency, branch misprediction delays, etc.

The systems fall into two groups.  The first includes
<I>pixie</I><A HREF="references.html#MIPS90">[MIPS90]</A>,
<I>gprof</I><A HREF="references.html#GraKM82">[GraKM82]</A>,
<I>jprof</I><A HREF="references.html#ReiS94">[ReiS94]</A>,
<I>quartz</I><A HREF="references.html#AndL91">[AndL91]</A>,
<I>MTOOL</I><A HREF="references.html#GolH93">[GolH93]</A>,
<I>SimOS</I><A HREF="references.html#RosHWG95">[RosHWG95]</A>,
part of SGI's <I>SpeedShop</I><A HREF="references.html#Zag96">[Zag96]</A>,
and Intel's <I>VTune</I> dynamic 
analyzer<A HREF="references.html#Vtune">[VTune]</A>.
These systems use binary modification,
compiler support, or direct simulation of programs to gather
measurements.  They all have high overhead and usually require
significant user intervention.  The slowdown is too large for
continuous measurements during production use, despite techniques that
reduce instrumentation overhead 
substantially<A HREF="references.html#BalL94">[BalL94]</A>.  In
addition, only the simulation-based systems provide accurate
information about the locations and causes of stalls.
</P>

<P>
The systems in the second group use statistical sampling to collect
fine-grained information on program or system behavior.  Some sampling
systems, including <I>Morph</I><A HREF="references.html#Zha97">[Zha97]</A>,
<I>prof</I><A HREF="references.html#prof">[prof]</A>,
and part of <I>SpeedShop</I>, rely on an existing source
of interrupts (e.g., timer interrupts) to generate program-counter
samples.  This prevents them from sampling within those interrupt
routines, and can also result in correlations between the sampling and
other system activity.  By using hardware performance counters and
randomizing the interval between samples, we are able to sample
activity within essentially the entire system (except for our
interrupt handler itself) and to avoid correlations with any other
activity.  This issue is discussed further in
<A HREF="collection.html#period">Section 4.1.1</A>
</P>

<P>
Other systems that use performance counters, including
<I>iprobe</I><A HREF="references.html#Ipr">[Ipr]</A>,
the <I>VTune</I> sampler<A HREF="references.html#Vtune">[VTune]</A>, 
and part of <I>SpeedShop</I>, share some of the characteristics of our system.
However, <I>iprobe</I> and <I>VTune</I>
cannot be used for continuous profiling,
mostly because they need a lot of memory for sample data.  In
addition, <I>iprobe</I>, the <I>VTune</I> sampler,
and <I>SpeedShop</I> all fail to map the
sample data accurately back to individual instructions.  In contrast,
our tools produce an accurate accounting of stall cycles incurred by
each instruction and the potential reason(s) for the stalls.
