We would like to thank Mike Burrows, Allan Heydon, Hal Murray, Sharon
Perl, and Sharon Smith for helpful comments that greatly improved the
content and presentation of this paper; the anonymous referees for
SOSP and TOCS also provided numerous helpful comments.  We would also
like to thank Dawson Engler for initially suggesting the use of
inter-processor interrupts to avoid expensive synchronization
operations in the interrupt handler, Mitch Lichtenberg for his work on
the Alpha/NT version of our system and in general for his help and
suggestions on the project, and the developers of iprobe for supplying
us with source code that helped us get off the ground in building the
early versions of our data collection system.  Finally, we would like
to thank Gary Carleton and Bob Davies of Intel for answering our
questions about VTune and Marty Itzkowitz of SGI for answering our
questions about SpeedShop.
