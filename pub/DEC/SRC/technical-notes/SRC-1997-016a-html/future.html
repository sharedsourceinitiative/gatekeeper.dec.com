7.  Future Directions
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
There are a number of interesting opportunities for future research.
We plan to focus primarily on new profile-driven optimizations that
can exploit the fine-grained information supplied by our analysis tools.
Work is already underway to drive existing compile-time, link-time,
and binary-rewriting optimizations using profile data, and to
integrate optimizers and our profiling system into a single
"continuous optimization" system that runs in the background
improving the performance of key programs.
</P>

<P>
We also plan to further optimize and extend our existing
infrastructure.  We are currently investigating hardware and software
mechanisms to capture more information with each sample, such as
referenced memory addresses, register values, and branch directions.
We have already prototyped two general software extensions:
instruction interpretation and double sampling.
</P>

<P>
Interpretation involves decoding the instruction associated with the
sampled PC, and determining if useful information should be extracted
and recorded.  For example, each conditional branch can be interpreted
to determine whether or not the branch will be taken, yielding "edge
samples" that should prove valuable for analysis and optimization.
Double sampling is an alternate technique that can be used to obtain
edge samples.  During selected performance counter interrupts, a
second interrupt is setup to occur immediately after returning from
the first, providing two PC values along an execution path. Careful
coding can ensure that the second PC is the very next one to be
executed, directly providing edge samples; two or more samples could
also be used to form longer execution path profiles.
</P>

<P>
We are also developing a graphical user interface to improve
usability, as well as tools for interactively visualizing and
exploring profile data.  Finally, we are working with hardware
designers to develop sampling support for the next generation of Alpha
processors, which uses an out-of-order execution model that presents a
number of challenges.
