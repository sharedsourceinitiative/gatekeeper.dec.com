The ideal distributed file system would provide all its users with
coherent, shared access to the same set of files, yet would be
arbitrarily scalable to provide more storage space and higher
performance to a growing user community.  It would be highly available
in spite of component failures.  It would require minimal human
administration, and administration would not become more complex as more
components were added. <p>

Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet was
relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure.  The
lower layer is Petal, a distributed
storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly
available, automatically managed virtual disks.  In the upper layer,
multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top of a shared
Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to ensure
coherence. <p>

Frangipani is meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under a
common administration and can communicate securely.  Thus the machines
trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is practical.
Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to untrusted
machines using ordinary network file access protocols. <p>

We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas running
DIGITAL Unix 4.0.  Initial measurements indicate that Frangipani has
excellent single-server performance and scales well as servers are
added.
