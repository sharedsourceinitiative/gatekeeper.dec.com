We address the problem of determining the time in a network where 
a node may obtain information indirectly from primary time sources 
via intermediate nodes.  Our key idea is to transmit and store 
each time datum as a pair, consisting of a time interval and 
a "failure predicate", a boolean expression that indicates precisely 
which combinations of node failures could invalidate the interval.  
We describe some techniques based on this idea, but not a complete 
system design or implementation.
