AltaVista is a phenomenally successful Web searching tool introduced 
by Digital Equipment Corporation in December 1995. As of early 1997 
<a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com">AltaVista Search</a>
provides free, fast, public access to a Web index of 31 million 
web pages and is accessed over 29 million times per weekday. This 
talk gives an overview of the implementation of the AltaVista search 
engine. It summarizes the techniques used to fetch Web pages, build 
the index, and answer queries. A graph shows how the daily AltaVista query
load has grown more than linearly since the service was introduced.
