Constraints are an important enabling technology for interactive
graphics applications. However, today's constraint-based systems are
plagued by several limitations, and constraints have yet to live up
to their potential.<p>

Juno-2 is a constraint-based double-view drawing editor that
addresses some of these limitations. Constraints allow you to
specify locations in your drawing declaratively. The constraints are
maintained whenever part of the picture is changed, so constraints
make it easier to modify a drawing. Some constraints are pre-defined
by the Juno-2 application, but the program also includes a powerful
extension language that allows users to define new constraints. The
system demonstrates that fast constraint solving is possible with a
highly extensible, fully declarative constraint language.<p>

The talk will include a videotape demonstration of Juno-2, including
some of our recent experiments using it to model constrained three-
dimensional shapes and to produce animations.
