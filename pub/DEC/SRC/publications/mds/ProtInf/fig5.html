Fig. 5. An organization separating addressing from protection descriptors, using a segmented memory. The address passed from the processor to the memory consists of two parts: a unique segment identifier and an offset. Program A is in control. (Compare with Fig. 2(a).) In later figures the map containing addressing descriptors will be omitted for clarity, but it is assumed to be present in the actual implementation of a segmented memory.
