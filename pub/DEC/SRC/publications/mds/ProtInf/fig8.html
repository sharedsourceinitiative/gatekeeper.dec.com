Fig. 8. Conceptual model of an access controller. When a virtual processor attempts to refer to the segment associated with the access controller, the memory system looks up the principal identifier in the access control list part. If found, the permissions associated with that entry of the access control list, together with the addressing descriptor, are used to complete the access.
