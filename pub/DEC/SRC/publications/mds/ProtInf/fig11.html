Fig. 11. Use of "shadow" capability registers to speed up an access
control list system. When a pointer register containing a unique identifier is flrst wed, the shadow register is automatically loaded from the access controller to which the unique identifier refers. Later wes of that pointer register thw do not require reference to the access controller. Storing of a pointer register means storing of the unique identifier only; the shadow register is never stored.
