Fig. 9. A revision of Fig. 5, with the addition of an access controller as an indirect address to be used on all references by the processor to the memory. Since the access controller contains permission bits, they no longer need appear in the processor registers, which have been renamed "pointer" registers. Note that the privileged state bit of the processor has been replaced with a principal identifier register.
