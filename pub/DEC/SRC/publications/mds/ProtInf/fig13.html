Fig. 13. Hierarchical control of authority to modify access control lists. Each access controller has an extra field in addition to those of Fig. 12; the extra field contains the unique identifier of some higher level access controller. Authority to access segments A, X, and Y is controlled by access controllers AC<sub>1</sub>, AC<sub>2</sub>, and AC<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Authority to modify AC<sub>1</sub> and AC<sub>2</sub>: is in turn controlled by AC<sub>4</sub>, while authority to modify AC<sub>3</sub> is controlled by AC<sub>5</sub>. Authority to modify AC<sub>4</sub> and AC<sub>5</sub>, is controlled by AC<sub>6</sub>, which is the first access controller in the system. In this example, the authority to modify AC<sub>6</sub> is similar to the self-control scheme. Note that segments S4, S5, and S6 may be degenerate; AC<sub>4</sub>, AC<sub>5</sub>, and AC<sub>6</sub> may exist solely to control the authority to modify other access controllers. The meaning of the backpointer, say, from AC<sub>1</sub> to AC<sub>1</sub>, is that if a user attempts to modify the access control list of AC<sub>1</sub>, the backpointer is foUowed, leading to AC<sub>1</sub>. Only if the user's principal identifier h found in AC<sub>4</sub> (with appropriate permission) is the modification to AC<sub>1</sub> permitted. Segments A, X, and Y are arranged in an independent hierarchy of their own, with A superior to X and Y, by virtue of the pointer values P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> found in segment A.
