<P>The Historical Society has a wonderful 19th Century landscape painted by 
Gilbert Munger [1837-1903], who lived and painted in Duluth during several 
periods of his life. This painting was probably done in Duluth, since its 1872 
date matches a period when Munger was a resident. However, one look convinces 
us that the scene is not in Minnesota. A hint to the subject is the inscription 
&quot;Donna Lake&quot; on the back, apparently in Munger’s hand. Where is Donna 
Lake and why did Munger paint it? I have spent some time tracking down the 
answers. They tell us something of Munger’s adventures further West.

<P>Munger’s best paintings rival those by more famous contemporaries like 
Albert Bierstadt, William Keith, and Thomas Hill. But Munger’s life and work 
have not been studied much. Munger was born in Connecticut and went to 
Washington DC at age 13 to learn natural history and landscape engraving. Here 
he taught himself to paint on frequent walks to the woods. During the Civil War 
he was a construction engineer in the Union Army. In 1866 he moved to New York 
City, where he had some success as an artist. A year later he relocated to 
Duluth to join his brother Roger, who settled there permanently. During this 
first stay in Minnesota Gilbert worked on a large painting of Minnehaha Falls 
that received favorable reviews from newspaper art critics.</P>

<P>At this time Munger also painted a view of Northern California’s Mt. Shasta, 
dated 1867, that is now at the Tweed Art Museum in Duluth. This painting is a 
bit of a puzzle, because as far as anyone can tell he had never been west of 
Minnesota at that time. Alfred Harrison of North Point Gallery in San 
Francisco, an expert on early Western landscape painters, speculates that 
Munger painted Mt. Shasta either from a photograph or from a painting by the 
early California landscape painter Frederick Butman. This case is a warning to 
the amateur art sleuth (me) that things are not always what they seem.</P>

<P>In 1869 Munger joined the US. Government’s Geological Exploration of the 
40th Parallel as a guest artist. That summer he traveled and painted with a 
survey team in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains of Utah, ending up in San 
Francisco in November. We are fortunate that Munger joined this enterprise, for 
it was headed by Clarence King, one of the most famous scientists and explorers 
of his day, who went on to become the head of the US Geological Survey in 
Washington DC. The 40th Parallel work was carefully documented in government 
records and King’s life has been researched by many historians. We may not be 
able to discover much about Munger directly from historical records, but we can 
track him through King’s activities during this period.</P>

<P>Munger became good friends with King. They hung out together in San 
Francisco during the first part of 1870, where Munger got good reviews from the 
local press for his paintings. Munger accompanied the next portion of the 
expedition that Fall on which King inspected the glaciers of Mt. Shasta. While 
Munger did climb the mountain, he apparently spent most of his time painting at 
the base. He went on without King to paint Mt. Hood in Oregon and then returned 
to San Francisco. At the end of 1870 Munger returned east to New York City, 
finally arriving back in Duluth in the summer of 1871. By mid 1872 (we must 
assume that our painting is finished by now) the West called again and Munger 
left for a painting trip  to California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. He 
arrived back in Duluth early in 1874. By 1877 Munger had departed for Europe 
and did not return to America until 1893. His last years were spent in Duluth 
and Washington DC.</P>

<P>It seemed a good bet that Donna Lake was associated with the King 
expeditions. The results were published in the 1870s as a seven volume set. 
Volume 1, one of the last to be published, in 1878, is Clarence King’s 
monumental work <I>Systematic Geology</I>. In the list of illustrations we find 
that the ten chromolithographs are &quot;after studies by Gilbert Munger&quot;. 
Unfortunately, the copy in which I first discovered this fact was missing most 
of these color plates. In a complete copy I found later, however,  I saw that 
Plate II: <I>Lake Marian Humboldt Range Nevada</I>,  reproduced here, obviously 
depicts the same lake as our painting.</P>

<P>From the expedition records it was now straightforward to discover that 
Clarence King found this lake in the summer of 1868, a year before Munger 
joined him. King was so taken with the lake that he named it after his little 
sister Marian. As a Christmas present to her in 1870 he published a book, 
printed in an edition of three, containing an account of the discovery of the 
lake, photographs of the site, and a poem he wrote about the lake. (King was a 
better explorer and geologist than poet.) Two other lakes, in Utah, received 
similar treatment in honor of Marian’s girl friends Jan and Lall. </P>

<P>So the Donna Lake painting depicts King’s Lake Marian, which is somewhere in 
Nevada. Expedition records and other documents, however, fail to place Munger 
at the lake. King discovered it before Munger joined him and no records have 
King or Munger back there later. The best clue we have is a sentence in the 
diary of compatriot Samuel Franklin Emmons, who mentions a Munger sketch of 
Lake Marian in the entry for August 19, 1870. And we still have  the problems 
of finding the location of the actual lake and learning why Munger called it 
Donna Lake.</P>

<P>In the first half of 1871 Munger showed a painting titled &quot;Lake 
Marian,&quot; listed as owned by Clarence King, at exhibitions in New York, New 
Haven, and Boston. This must be a different depiction of the subject, however, 
since the date is too early for it to be our 1872 painting. The exhibition 
painting may be an undated 11&quot; x 22&quot; canvas, showing almost the same 
prospect, that appeared on the art market in 1993. Our 1872 painting, which 
measures 18&quot; x 30&quot;, may have been done based on this smaller one (and 
that one from an expedition photograph). There are other similar pairs of 
Munger paintings of Western scenes. In each pair one is an 11&quot; x 22&quot; 
study and the other a larger studio painting. The subjects are Mt. Hood in 
Oregon, Lake Lall in Utah,  and the Wasatch Range in Utah.</P>

<P>Someone else solved the problem of the location of Lake Marian for me. In 
the June, 1939 issue of the <I>Sierra Club Bulletin</I>, Francis Farquhar 
published an article on his efforts to locate Lakes Marian, Jan, and Lall. His 
interest arose from seeing a copy of King’s Christmas book, which is reprinted 
in the article. Following clues in the book and information from the expedition 
records, Farquhar located Lake Marian in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada, about 30 
miles southeast of Elko. He journeyed there and took photographs that show 
conclusively he had the right lake. The article juxtaposes his photographs with 
those from the King expedition and they match exactly. In the years between 
1868 and 1939, however, Lake Marian had reverted to its original name of 
&quot;Overland Lake&quot;, by which it is still known. Apparently King 
appropriated an already-named lake for his sister.</P>

<P>This brings us back to the &quot;Donna Lake&quot; inscription on the 1872 
painting. Here I am still stumped. Historians of the area assure me that there 
has never been a Donna Lake in Northeastern Nevada. A possible explanation is 
that Munger mislabeled the painting. He did visit and paint the famous Donner 
Lake in California and it bears a resemblance to Lake Marian. Another 
explanation is that someone else wrote the label and got it wrong.</P>
