High-performance scalable interconnects allow us to build large-scale
computing systems consisting of hundreds of computing nodes.  The practical
deployment and use of such systems is often limited by our ability to
manage them.  This problem is particularly severe for large-scale storage
systems, because they must reliably store and manage vast amounts of
information over long periods of time.  We believe that such systems
must be designed from the ground up to be highly available, incrementally
expandable in both capacity and performance, and support mechanisms for
automating the configuration and management of the system.<p>

Petal is a distributed storage system consisting of a collection of
network-connected storage servers that cooperatively implement a single
logical storage system.  The system allows clients to create, access and
delete virtual disks of almost arbitrary size on demand.  Each virtual disk
can be accessed as if it were a locally attached disk from a single or multiple
cooperating machines using the standard UNIX character and block device
interfaces.  Data stored on virtual disks are automatically distributed
and replicated across multiple storage servers and disks to improve
performance and availability.  The system automatically tolerates and
recovers from all single component failures, communication failures, and can
be regionally distributed to survive site failures.  Instantaneous
copies of virtual disks, called snapshots, can be created in under a second
and simplifies the task of making consistent backups.  Recent snapshots
can be kept online to allow users to retrieve accidentally deleted files
without help from a system administrator.  Additional servers and disks can
be added incrementally, online, without disturbing users of the storage system;
data is automatically redistributed in the background to take advantage
of the additional capacity and performance of the new components.  This
talk will describe the motivation, design, and performance of Petal.
