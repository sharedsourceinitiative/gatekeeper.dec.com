Object-oriented languages were invented to provide an intuitive view of
data and computation, by drawing an analogy between software and the
physical world of objects. The detailed explanation of this intuition,
however, turned out to be quite complex; there are still no standard
definitions of such fundamental notions as objects, classes, and
inheritance.
<p>
Much progress was made by investigating the notion of subtyping within
procedural languages and their theoretical models (lambda calculi). These
studies clarified the role of subtyping in object-oriented languages, but
still relied on complex encodings to model object-oriented features.
Recently, in joint work with Martin Abadi, I have studied more direct
models of object-oriented features: object calculi.
<p>
Object calculi embody, in a minimal setting, the object-oriented model of
computation, as opposed to the imperative, functional, and process models.
Object calculi are based exclusively on objects and methods, not on
functions or data structures. They help in classifying and explaining the
features of object-oriented languages, and in designing new, more regular
languages. They directly inspired my design of Obliq, an object-oriented
language for network programming.
