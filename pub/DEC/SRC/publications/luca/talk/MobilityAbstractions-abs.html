There are two distinct areas of work in mobility: "mobile computing", 
concerning computation that is carried out in mobile devices, and 
"mobile computation", concerning mobile code that moves between 
devices. These distinctions are destined to vanish. We aim to describe 
all aspects of mobility within a single framework that encompasses 
mobile agents, the ambients where agents interact and the mobility of 
the ambients themselves.
<p>
The main difficulty with mobile computation is not in mobility per se, 
but in the crossing of administrative domains. Mobile programs must be 
equipped to navigate a hierarchy of domains, at every step obtaining 
authorization to move further. Therefore, at the most fundamental 
level we need to capture notions of locations, of mobility and of 
authorization to move.
<p>
We identify "mobile ambients" as a fundamental abstraction that 
generalizes both dynamic agents and the static domains they must cross.
From a formal point of view we develop a simple but computationally 
powerful calculus that directly embodies domains and mobility (and 
little else). The calculus forms the basis of a small-language/
Java-library. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the approach by a 
series of examples, including showing how a notion such as "crossing 
a firewall" has a direct and analyzable interpretation.
