I discuss the foundations of object-based programming. Recent results 
validate the long-standing intuition that everything can be represented in 
terms of objects, including functions and classes. Similarly, function types 
and class types can be represented via object types. The basic constructions 
are simple, flexible, and powerful. So, why are object-based languages
not taking over the (class-based) world?
