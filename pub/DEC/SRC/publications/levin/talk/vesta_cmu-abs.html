<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>

Software systems just keep getting bigger, and the technology to 
manage their construction and evolution has not kept pace.  As a 
result, the world is full of easy-to-use, small-scale configuration 
management tools and large-scale, hard-to-use ones.  The Vesta project 
at the Systems Research Center is a research effort to address this 
problem.<p>

This talk begins with a description of "the software configuration 
management problem", then focuses on the key technical difficulties 
that must be overcome in order to manage the development of a software 
system of practically any size (that is, tens of millions of source-code 
lines).  It then presents the Vesta approach and reports our experience 
with a highly functional prototype system.  The talk concludes by 
describing how the Vesta system presently under construction provides 
reproducible, incremental construction of arbitrarily large software 
systems.
