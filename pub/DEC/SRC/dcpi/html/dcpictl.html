<H3>COMMANDS</H3>

<P>

<DL>
<DT>flush<P>

<DD>Flush all unsaved in-memory samples to their associated profiles in
the on-disk profile database.  This command is useful for explicitly
forcing all samples to nonvolatile storage.<P>

Samples are normally only saved to disk periodically (e.g. every few
minutes), or when driver buffer space is running low.  The <I>quit</I>
and <I>epoch</I> commands also flush all unsaved samples to disk.<P>

<DT>epoch<P>

<DD>Starts a new profiling epoch after flushing all unsaved in-memory
samples to their associated profiles in the on-disk profile database.
The <I>flush</I> command can be used to flush unsaved samples without
starting a new epoch.<P>

Epochs are designed to capture relatively coarse time intervals
measured in minutes.  An epoch is represented by a GMT (Greenwich Mean
Time) timestamp for the start of the epoch, in YYMMDDHHMM format.  For
example, the epoch 9612042334 corresponds to December 4, 1996 at 23:34
GMT (or December 4, 1996 at 15:34 PST).<P>

<DT>quit<P>

<DD>Terminates the active dcpid(1) daemon after flushing all unsaved
in-memory samples to their associated profiles in the on-disk profile
database.  The <I>flush</I> command can be used to flush unsaved samples
without terminating dcpid(1).<P>

<DT>register <I>pid</I> [<I>start</I> <I>size</I> <I>imageid</I>] <I>image name</I><P>

<DD>Notifies dcpid(1) that the named image is loaded into the process
named by <TT>pid</TT>. If the optional <TT>start</TT>, <TT>size</TT>, and <TT>imageid</TT>
parameters are not specified, their values are read from the named
image.  <TT>Start</TT> specifies the address at which the text section of
the image is mapped into the process.  <TT>Size</TT> is the size of the
image text section in bytes.  <TT>Imageid</TT> is the image identifier for
the image (see <TT>dcpiscan</TT>.)<P>

This facility is useful only in unusual circumstances: for example,
when the image is loaded into the process via mmap instead of by the
image loader or the <TT>dlopen</TT> library call.<P>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpictl provides control over the operation of the dcpid(1) daemon.
It is structured as a client application that causes a command to be
invoked at the daemon.  The programs dcpiflush(1), dcpiepoch(1), and
dcpiquit(1) are now implemented as shell scripts that simply invoke
dcpictl with the appropriate options.<P>

In contrast to earlier implementations of dcpiflush(1), dcpiepoch(1),
and dcpiquit(1), commands are invoked synchronously by dcpictl;
dcpictl does not exit until a reply is received from the daemon.
