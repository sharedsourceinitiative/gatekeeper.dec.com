<P>

<DL>
<DT>-help<DD> Print out usage information.<P>

<DT>-version<DD> Print out the version number.<P>

<DT>-verbose<DD> Verbose.  Print out additional information.<P>

<DT>-source_line<DD>
Print out statistics by source line number.  If the <I>image-name</I> of
the two sets are the same, then the default is to print out the statistics
by basic block.  If the <I>image-name</I> is different, then the
statistics can only be printed by source line number. <P>

<DT>-compare type<DD> 
Specify the kind of information compared.  The <I>type</I> is a comma-separated
list of the following keywords: <I>cpi</I>, <I>frequency</I>, <I>stalls</I>, 
<I>static_stalls</I>, <I>dynamic_stalls</I> or <I>all</I>.  The default is
to compare CPI only.<P>

<DT>-set<DD>
Denote the start of a set of sample files.  All samples within a set
are combined, and samples across different sets are compared.

<H3>Set Options</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-conf_low<DD>  Compare low, medium, and high-confidence data.<P>

<DT>-conf_high<DD> Compare only high-confidence data. (Default is to compare
medium and high-confidence data).<P>

<DT>-cross_procedure [optimistic | pessimistic | selective]<DD> Choose what
assumption to make when encountering a procedure call boundary while
looking for reasons to explain dynamic stalls.  A procedure call boundary
is either a call made by the procedure being analyzed or the beginning or
end of that procedure.  With <I>pessimistic</I>, we assume that
whatever happens outside the analyzed procedure can cause a dynamic stall
inside it.  With <I>optimistic</I>, we assume that it cannot.  With
<I>selective</I>, the assumption is based on standard procedure call
convention.  (The default is <I>optimistic</I>.)<P>

<H3>PROFILE FILE FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By default, this command automatically finds all of the relevant
profile files.  The following options can be used to guide the search
for the profile files.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-db &lt;directory name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the specified profile database directory.
The directory name should be the same name as the one specified when
<TT>dcpid</TT> was started.  I.e., the named directory should contain a
set of epochs.  If this option is not specified, the directory name is
obtained from the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable.  If neither this
option, nor the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable are set, the name of
the directory used by the last invocation of <TT>dcpid</TT> on this
machine is used.  If none of these methods succeed in finding the
appropriate directory, and no explicit set of profile files is
provided via the <TT>-profiles</TT> option, then the command fails.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest<DD>
Search for profile files in the latest epoch.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest-k<DD>
Search for profile files in the "k+1"th oldest epoch.  For example,
search in the third last epoch if "-epoch latest-2" is specified.<P>

<DT>-epoch all<DD>
Search for profile files in all epochs.<P>

<DT>-epoch &lt;name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the named epoch.  The epoch name should be
the name of a subdirectory corresponding to a single epoch within the
profile database directory.  Epoch subdirectory names usually take
the form <TT>YYMMDDHHMM</TT> (year-month-day-hours-minutes).  For example,
an epoch started on December 4, 1996 at 23:34 is named <TT>9612042334</TT>.
If an epoch is given a symbolic name by creating a symbol link to
the actual epoch directory, then the symbolic name can also be used
as an argument to the <TT>-epoch</TT> option.<P>

<DT>-events all<DD>
Search for profile files corresponding to all event types such as
cycles, icache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-events type(+type)*<DD>
Search for profiles files for the specified event types.  For example,
search for cycles, icache misses, and data cache misses when the
option <TT>-events cycles+imiss+dmiss</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-events all(-type)*<DD>
Search for profile files for all event types except for the specified
types.  For example, search for all event types except for branch
mispredictions when the option <TT>-events all-branchmp</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-label &lt;label&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files with the specified label (see <TT>dcpilabel</TT>).
If no labels are specified on the command line, profile file labels
are ignored entirely.  If any labels are specified on the command line
(this option can be repeated several times), only profile files that
have one of the specified labels are used.<P>

<DT>-profiles &lt;file names...&gt; --<DD>
Use just the profile files named by the specified file names.  The
list of profile file names can be terminated either via <TT>--</TT>, or by
the end of the option list.  The command prints an error message and
fails if the <TT>-profiles</TT> option is used in conjunction with any of
the earlier automatic profile finding options.  (Use either the
automatic profile lookup mechanism, or explicitly name the profile
file with the <TT>-profile</TT> option, but not both.)

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dcpidiff compares two sets of profiles for a procedure and prints out
various statistics.  It can compare the CPI, frequency, and static and
dynamic stall cycles.  If the images for the two sets of profiles are
the same, then it compares them by basic block.  If the images differ,
then it compares by source line number.  <P>

For each basic block (or source line) it prints the normalized range
(i.e. the difference between the values over the sum of the values,
expressed as a percentage), the two values and the ratio of the
values.  All entries are sorted by the normalized range so that the
focus is on the entries that differ the most.  The available options
for each of the two sets is similar to the options for

<H3>EXAMPLE USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>

<DT><TT>dcpidiff the_proc -set &lt;image-name&gt; -epoch latest
                            -set &lt;image-name&gt; -epoch latest-1</TT><DD>
Use dcpidiff to compare the CPI of procedure <TT>the_proc</TT> in two
different sets of sample files.<P>

<DT><TT>dcpidiff -compare frequency the_proc -set &lt;image-name&gt; -epoch latest
              -set -xct the_program.xct -tab the_program.tab &lt;image-name&gt; -epoch latest-1</TT><DD>
Use dcpidiff to compare the basic block frequencies in procedure
<TT>the_proc</TT> as estimated by the dcpi tools, against the frequencies
computed by the <A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A>.<P>
