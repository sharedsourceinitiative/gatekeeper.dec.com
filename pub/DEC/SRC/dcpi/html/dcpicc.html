<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

dcpicc is intended to be used as a C compiler to produce object code that
would help <A HREF="dcpisource.html">dcpisource</A> in identifying which source
token each instruction corresponds to.<P>

dcpicc tokenizes each C source file named on the command line and compiles
the tokenized source files with a real C compiler.  dcpicc-tokenize, which
dcpicc invokes, reads the input C source file from standard input and
writes the tokenized source file to standard output, leaving the mapping
(as described below) in <I>map-file</I>.  A tokenized source file has one
source token per line, so that line numbers in the object file's symbol
table identify individual tokens rather than source lines.  dcpicc stores
in a map file the mapping from line numbers recorded in the object file
(which identify lines in the tokenized source file) to tokens in the
original source file.  This mapping is used by dcpisource.<P>

Other files named on the command line are not changed.  All arguments not
recognized by dcpicc are passed to the C compiler.<P>

dcpicc must be allowed to write the directory containing the original
source files.

<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>

<DT>-map_dir <I>map-directory</I><DD> If set, dcpicc puts the map file for
foo.c, named foo.cmap, in the specified directory.  Otherwise, the map file
is in the same directory as foo.c.<P>

<DT>-tok_dir <I>token-directory</I><DD> If set, dcpicc keeps the tokenized
source file for foo.c, named foo.tok.c, in the specified directory.
Otherwise, the tokenized source file is discarded after compilation.<P>

<DT>-compiler <I>C-compiler</I><DD> If set, dcpicc invokes the specified C
compiler.  Otherwise, dcpicc invokes the C compiler named by the
environment variable <TT>CC</TT>, or <TT>cc</TT> if <TT>CC</TT> is not defined.<P>

</DL>

<H3>LIMITATIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

dcpicc should be used only for programs that have been fully debugged and
are being studied only for performance improvement.  Since each source
token is put on a different line, the line numbers seen by the real C
compiler and the debugger are not those in the original source file.
Therefore, compiler messages would become very hard to interpret, and
debugger commands for stopping at specified source lines would be difficult
to use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>TYPICAL USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Typically, <TT>dcpicc</TT> is used like a C compiler.
