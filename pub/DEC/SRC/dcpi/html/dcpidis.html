<H3>NAME</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
dcpidis - Disassemble a procedure and print sample counts for each instruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>WARNING</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>dcpidis</TT> is obsolete.  Use <TT>dcpilist</TT> instead, which provides
much more functionality, including the ability to print source code
as well as estimated cycle costs per instruction and source line.

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>dcpidis</B> -p <I>procedure-name</I> <I>image-file</I> [<I>sample-files...</I>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>-p <I>procedure-name</I><DD>
Prints information for the specified procedure.  Unlike <TT>dis</TT>, the
current version of <TT>dcpidis</TT> can only print one procedure at a time,
and therefore the <TT>-p</TT> flag is required.  If multiple procedures in
the image have the same name, you can just give the address of one of
these procedures instead of an ambiguous name.
</DL>
<P>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpidis generates a disassembled listing for a named procedure that is
extracted from a specified image file.  The disassembly is annotated
with samples that were collected by <TT>dcpid</TT> and then stored in the
named sample files.<P>

Instead of a procedure name, the <TT>-p</TT> flag also accepts an address.
Therefore, if an image contains multiple procedures with the same
name, you can give an address that falls within one of these
procedures to disambiguate the procedure selection.<P>

Samples that do not belong to the specified procedure are ignored.  If
no sample files are provided, a sample count of zero is assumed for
each instruction.  If multiple sample files contribute to the samples
for the specified procedure, these samples are merged together in the
output.<P>

If the specified sample files contain samples for multiple events,
then a column for the count of each kind of event is included in the
disassembled listing.
