<H3>NAME</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
dcpix - Instrument a program to get basic block and edge counts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>dcpix</B> myprog [-conservative]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<TT>Dcpix</TT> is similar to pixie except that it measures executions of both
basic blocks and edges between them.<P>

<TT>Dcpix</TT> is used in conjunction with stall analysis tools
(<A HREF="dcpicalc.html">dcpicalc(1)</A>,
<A HREF="dcpitopstalls.html">dcpitopstalls(1)</A>,
<A HREF="dcpiwhatcg.html">dcpiwhatcg(1)</A>).  Normally, these tools must
estimate execution counts of basic blocks and edges.  These
estimates are sometimes inaccurate.<P>

For deterministic programs, one can measure the execution counts
using <TT>dcpix</TT> and supply the results to stall analysis tools.  The
program must be deterministic because it must be run twice: once under
<TT>dcpix</TT> to measure execution counts, and once under
<A HREF="dcpid.html">dcpid(1)</A> to gather sample data.<P>

By default, <TT>dcpix</TT> instruments only a set of blocks and edges that is
sufficient for computing counts for all blocks and edges by exploiting flow
constraints.  However, this is inaccurate for programs that call <TT>longjmp</TT>
(or similar routines).  With the <TT>-conservative</TT> flag, <TT>dcpix</TT>
adds instrumentation to every block.

<H3>TYPICAL USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<PRE>
  dcpix myprog		% creates myprog.dcpix and myprog.tab
  myprog.dcpix		% creates myprog.xct
  dcpicalc -tab myprog.tab -xct sum.xct -db db myprocedure myprog
</PRE>

To analyze the performance of multiple runs of myprog, one can do either:
<PRE>
  dcpicalc -tab myprog.tab -xct myprog1.xct \
           -xct myprog2.xct ... -xct myprogN.xct \
	   -db db myprocedure myprog
</PRE>

or:
<PRE>
  dcpisumxct myprog1.xct myprog2.xct ... -xct myprogN.xct -o sum.xct
  dcpicalc -tab myprog.tab -xct sum.xct -db db myprocedure myprog
</PRE>

Using <A HREF="dcpisumxct.html">dcpisumxct(1)</A> is more efficient when running
dcpicalc multiple times, e.g., on several procedures in the same program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>IMPLEMENTATION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpix is an atom tool that instruments all edges exiting a branching block
plus the entry block(s) of each procedure.  These measured counts are more
than enough to calculate counts for every block using "flow in = flow out"
constraints, unless your program executes an infinite loop.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>ENVIRONMENT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

If the environment variable DCPIX_ADDPID is set, the instrumented program
(e.g., myprog.dcpix) will append its pid to the names of .xct files.  Thus,
running the instrumented program multiple times shouldn't cause one run to
overwrite the .xct file from a previous run.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>LIMITATIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<TT>Dcpix</TT> has no locking, so it is inaccurate for multi-threaded code.
Also, it does not support programs that call fork().  <P>

Some single-threaded programs have nondeterministic implementations, e.g.,
implementations that uses ld_l/st_c.  Thus, the count for some blocks may
differ when you run myprog under dcpid and myprog.dcpix to generate the
counts files.<P>

The stall analysis tools currently introduce round-off errors into the
measured counts because it represents them as multiples of the
sampling periord.
