dcpiwhatcg - Where Have All The Cycles Gone (for an image)

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Given one or more image-files and some profile files, dcpiwhatcg
identifies what percent of the CYCLES samples that were spent
executing instructions vs. waiting for stalls of various categories.
The output is the same as the procedure-level output of
<A HREF="dcpicalc.html">dcpicalc(1)</A>, except that it covers all of the
procedures in the image-files rather than a single procedure.<P>

In addition, dcpiwhatcg optionally outputs a sorted list of the
procedures that contain samples blamed on a particular kind of stall,
e.g., "Branch mispredict".

<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-help<DD> Print information about options.<P>

<DT>-pr<DD> Print a progress report line before analyzing each procedure.<P>

<DT>-stall stall-kind<DD>  Output a sorted list of the procedures that
contain samples blamed on stall-kind.  Stall-kind must be the name
of a specific dynamic or static stall as listed in the "Where have all
the cycles gone?" output of dcpiwhatcg or <A HREF="dcpicalc.html">dcpicalc(1)</A>.
This option does not work for multiple image-files.<P>

<DT>-version<DD>  Print program version information.

<H3>EXECUTION COUNT AND STALL ANALYSIS FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The following options can be used to control the heuristics for estimating
execution counts and identifying the causes of stalls.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-conf_low<DD>  Generate low, medium, and high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-conf_med<DD>  Generate medium and high confidence data. (default)<P>

<DT>-conf_high<DD> Generate only high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-cross_procedure [optimistic | pessimistic | selective]<DD> Choose what
assumption to make when a procedure call boundary is encountered while
looking for reasons to explain dynamic stalls.  A procedure call boundary
is either a call made by the procedure being analyzed or the beginning or
end of that procedure.  With <I>pessimistic</I>, assume that
whatever happens outside the analyzed procedure can cause a dynamic stall
inside it.  With <I>optimistic</I>, assume that it cannot.  With
<I>selective</I>, the assumption is based on standard procedure call
convention.  (The default is <I>optimistic</I>.)<P>

<DT>-do_gp<DD> Use a (non-linear time) constraint solver to exploit global
flow constraints when estimating execution counts.  The 
estimates may still violate flow constraints.<P>

<DT>-tab foo.tab<DD> Get execution counts from output of
<A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> instead of making estimates, which may be
inaccurate.  Requires a .xct file.<P>

<DT>-xct foo.xct<DD> Get execution counts from output of
<A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> instead of making estimates, which may be
inaccurate.  Requires a .tab file.<P>

<DT>-xct_factor num<DD> Scales counts from .xct files by num.  Useful when
you run a program once under <A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> but multiple (num)
times under <A HREF="dcpid.html">dcpid(1)</A> to get more samples.  Used in
conjuction with -tab and -xct.<P>

</DL>

<H3>PROFILE FILE FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By default, this command automatically finds all of the relevant
profile files.  The following options can be used to guide the search
for the profile files.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-db &lt;directory name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the specified profile database directory.
The directory name should be the same name as the one specified when
<TT>dcpid</TT> was started.  I.e., the named directory should contain a
set of epochs.  If this option is not specified, the directory name is
obtained from the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable.  If neither this
option, nor the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable are set, the name of
the directory used by the last invocation of <TT>dcpid</TT> on this
machine is used.  If none of these methods succeed in finding the
appropriate directory, and no explicit set of profile files is
provided via the <TT>-profiles</TT> option, then the command fails.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest<DD>
Search for profile files in the latest epoch.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest-k<DD>
Search for profile files in the "k+1"th oldest epoch.  For example,
search in the third last epoch if "-epoch latest-2" is specified.<P>

<DT>-epoch all<DD>
Search for profile files in all epochs.<P>

<DT>-epoch &lt;name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the named epoch.  The epoch name should be
the name of a subdirectory corresponding to a single epoch within the
profile database directory.  Epoch subdirectory names usually take
the form <TT>YYMMDDHHMM</TT> (year-month-day-hours-minutes).  For example,
an epoch started on December 4, 1996 at 23:34 is named <TT>9612042334</TT>.
If an epoch is given a symbolic name by creating a symbol link to
the actual epoch directory, then the symbolic name can also be used
as an argument to the <TT>-epoch</TT> option.<P>

<DT>-events all<DD>
Search for profile files corresponding to all event types such as
cycles, icache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-events type(+type)*<DD>
Search for profiles files for the specified event types.  For example,
search for cycles, icache misses, and data cache misses when the
option <TT>-events cycles+imiss+dmiss</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-events all(-type)*<DD>
Search for profile files for all event types except for the specified
types.  For example, search for all event types except for branch
mispredictions when the option <TT>-events all-branchmp</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-label &lt;label&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files with the specified label (see <TT>dcpilabel</TT>).
If no labels are specified on the command line, profile file labels
are ignored entirely.  If any labels are specified on the command line
(this option can be repeated several times), only profile files that
have one of the specified labels are used.<P>

<DT>-profiles &lt;file names...&gt; --<DD>
Use just the profile files named by the specified file names.  The
list of profile file names can be terminated either via <TT>--</TT>, or by
the end of the option list.  The command prints an error message and
fails if the <TT>-profiles</TT> option is used in conjunction with any of
the earlier automatic profile finding options.  (Use either the
automatic profile lookup mechanism, or explicitly name the profile
file with the <TT>-profile</TT> option, but not both.)

<H3>TYPICAL USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>LIMITATIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Because an internal DCPI interface was not designed for whole-program
analysis, the running time of this program is quadratic rather than linear in
size of the image file.  Thus, this program runs slowly on large image files.
