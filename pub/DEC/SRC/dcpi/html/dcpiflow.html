<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dcpiflow generates a basic block graph from a named procedure that is
extracted from a specified image file.  The basic block graph is
annotated with samples that were collected by <TT>dcpid</TT> and then
stored in the named sample files.  The basic block graph is printed on
standard output, and can be converted to postscript by dcpi2ps(1).  The
output can also be fed into dcpisource(1) for further
annotation.<P>

Instead of a procedure name, <TT>dcpiflow</TT> also accepts an address.
Therefore, if an image contains multiple procedures with the same
name, you can give an address that falls within one of these
procedures to disambiguate the procedure selection.<P>

Samples that do not belong to the specified procedure are ignored.  If
no sample files are provided, a sample count of zero is assumed for
each instruction.  If multiple sample files contribute to the samples
for the specified procedure, these samples are merged together in the
output.

<H3>INTERPRETING OUTPUT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Each node of the control flow graphs corresponds to a basic block.  If
the <TT>-samesize</TT> option is specified on the command line, each block
is assigned the same size.  Otherwise, blocks are scaled depending on
the number of samples and instructions in them: If the average number
of samples per instruction in small, the corresponding block is
printed using tiny font and contains just the start address of the
block. The larger the average number of samples per instruction, the
larger the font used to print the content of a block.<P>

All (except the smallest-font) nodes of the control flow graph consist
of multiple lines. The first line contains the last 24-bits of the
(hexadecimal) start address of the basic block. The remaining lines
contain the instructions of the basic block. Each line uses the
following format, from left to right:
<UL>
<LI> the last 24 bits of the instruction's address (hexadecimal),
<LI> the source line number (decimal) or 0 if the source code
cannot be found,
<LI> colon,
<LI> the instruction's 32-bit machine code (hexadecimal)
<LI> the instruction in mnemonics
<LI> the number of PC samples falling at this instruction address (decimal).
</UL>
<P>

<H3>TYPICAL USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Typically, <TT>dcpiflow</TT>, <TT>dcpisource</TT>, and
<TT>dcpi2ps</TT> are used together as follows:
<PRE>
dcpiflow idle_thread /vmunix vmunix* | \
dcpisource -f /src/kernel/kern/sched_prim.c | \
dcpi2ps -o idle_thread.ps 
</PRE>

<H3>PROBLEMS WITH JUMP TABLE TARGETS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the construction of the basic block graph, <TT>dcpiflow</TT> tries
to determine the targets of all computed jumps. If it fails to do so
for a jump, it prints an error message saying that it could not compute
jump table targets.  In such cases, the user can guide the operation
of dcpiflow by telling <TT>dcpiflow</TT> an upper and lower bound on the
value of the index register used in the jump.  <TT>dcpiflow</TT> then
uses the upper and lower bounds to determine all possible targets of
the computed jump.<P>

To tell <TT>dcpiflow</TT> an upper bound and a lower bound on the value of
the index register of a jump in an image, create a file called
"<TT>.dcpijumps</TT>" in the current directory or in the home directory.
This file should contain lines of the form:
<PRE>
    0x&lt;image_id in hex&gt;  0x&lt;jump address in hex&gt;  &lt;lower&gt;  &lt;upper&gt;
</PRE>

The file should contain one line for each image/compute-jump pair
for which dcpiflow could not automatically determine the targets.<P>

Use <TT>dcpiscan</TT> to determine the image_id for an image.<P>

<I>Example:</I><P>

When we run dcpiflow on a particular procedure, it prints the following
message to stderr:
<PRE>
   % dcpiflow ...
   0x12004bb10: could not compute jump table targets
</PRE>

The next step is to examine the disassembled code in the neighborhood
of the computed jump at address <TT>0x12004bb10</TT>.  (The output of either
dcpilist or dcpiflow can be used for this purpose.)

</PRE>

The pair of instructions <TT>cmpult/beq</TT> at <TT>0x12004baf8</TT> branch
away from the jump instruction if <TT>s5</TT> is not in the range
<TT>[0..0xd1]</TT>.  The <TT>ldq</TT> instruction loads into register <TT>at</TT>
the base address of the jump table associated with this computed jump.
The <TT>s4addq</TT> multiplies the index register <TT>s5</TT> by 4, adds it to
the base of the jump table to get a pointer into the jump table, and
stores the resulting pointer in register <TT>t11</TT>.  The <TT>ldl</TT>
instruction loads the corresponding jump table entry into <TT>t11</TT> and
the following <TT>addq</TT> adds the <TT>gp</TT> to the value of <TT>t11</TT>
since the jump entries are offsets from the contents of <TT>gp</TT>.<P>

Because of the <TT>cmpult/beq</TT> instruction pair, we know that the
<TT>jmp</TT> instruction is reachable only when the index register <TT>s5</TT>
has a value in the range <TT>[0..0xd1]</TT>.  Therefore, the following
entry should be placed in <TT>.dcpijumps</TT>:
<PRE>
     0x3249774100393048 0x12004bb10 0 209
</PRE>

(The image-id <TT>0x3249774100393048</TT> was determined by <TT>dcpiscan</TT>.)
