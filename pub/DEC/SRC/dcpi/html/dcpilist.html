dcpilist - Produce procedure listing annotated with profile information
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>dcpilist</B> [options]
[-p] <I>procedure-name</I>
<I>image-file</I><P>

<B>dcpilist</B> -V
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>-V<DD>
Prints version number and exits.<P>

<DT>-best<DD>
Prints source code if it is available, else prints a disassembly of
the specified procedure.  This is the default output format.<P>

<DT>-source<DD>
Prints source code.<P>

<DT>-asm<DD>
Prints a disassembly of the specified procedure.<P>

<DT>-both<DD>
Prints both the source code, and a disassembly of the specified
procedure.  The source code is always printed in line-number order.
If the <TT>-order</TT> option is not given, for each source line, the set
of instructions that correspond to the source line are printed
immediately after the source line in address order.  Since the
compiler can mix instructions that come from different source lines,
there may be gaps in the instruction output for a given source line.
These gaps are indicated with a line of the form <TT>...</TT>.  For
example,
<PRE>
    if (x-&gt;ptr != NULL)
    0x120022464 ldq     t2, 0(s6)
    ...
    0x120022470 beq     t2, 0x120023fc4
</PRE>

This output format does not guarantee that the instructions are
displayed in address order.  For example, in the listing below,
the instructions for the first two source lines are intermixed.
<PRE>
    a += x[0];
    0x120022504 ldq     t1, 0(s1)
    ...
    0x12002250c addq    s2, t1, s2
    b += x[1];
    0x120022508 ldq     t2, 0(s1)
    ...
    0x120022510 addq    s3, t2, s3
</PRE>

Therefore, the last instruction corresponding to the first source
line occurs after the first instruction corresponding to the second
source line, but is displayed earlier.<P>

If you specify the <TT>-order</TT> option, dcpilist produces a different
interleaving of the source code and the disassembled instructions.
The source lines are still printed in line number order.  In addition,
the instructions are all printed in address order.  To handle
instructions reordering, dcpilist will group a set of source lines
together and show the corresponding assembly instructions immediately
after the group of source lines.  The example above will produce the
following output if you specify the <TT>-order</TT> option.
<PRE>
    a += x[0];
    b += x[1];
    0x120022504 ldq     t1, 0(s1)
    0x120022508 ldq     t2, 0(s1)
    0x12002250c addq    s2, t1, s2
    0x120022510 addq    s3, t2, s3
</PRE>

The <TT>-order</TT> option is not turned on by default because it does not
work well under high optimizations levels when the compiler moves
two instructions that belong to the same source line far apart from
each other.<P>

<DT>-f <I>file</I><DD>
If dcpilist cannot find the source file automatically, the user can
specify the file name explicitly with this option.<P>

<DT>-lines<DD>
If this option is specified, dcpilist labels each source line and
disassembled instruction with the corresponding source line number.
This option can be helpful in understanding the output of <TT>-both
-order</TT>.<P>

<DT>-order<DD>
See the description of the <TT>-both</TT> option above.<P>

<DT>-conf_low<DD>
Output low, medium, and high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-conf_med<DD>
Output medium and high confidence data.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-conf_high<DD>
Output only high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-tk<DD>
Experimental option for generating Tcl code that places the output in
a Tk text widget.<P>

<DT>-ranks <I>n</I><DD>
When used in combination with the <TT>-tk</TT> option, each source line is
tagged with a rank in the range <TT>0..n-1</TT> where the rank is
determined by the number of samples that fell on that source line.
Higher samples imply a higher rank.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>PROFILE FILE FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By default, this command automatically finds all of the relevant
profile files.  The following options can be used to guide the search
for the profile files.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-db &lt;directory name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the specified profile database directory.
The directory name should be the same name as the one specified when
<TT>dcpid</TT> was started.  I.e., the named directory should contain a
set of epochs.  If this option is not specified, the directory name is
obtained from the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable.  If neither this
option, nor the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable are set, the name of
the directory used by the last invocation of <TT>dcpid</TT> on this
machine is used.  If none of these methods succeed in finding the
appropriate directory, and no explicit set of profile files is
provided via the <TT>-profiles</TT> option, then the command fails.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest<DD>
Search for profile files in the latest epoch.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest-k<DD>
Search for profile files in the "k+1"th oldest epoch.  For example,
search in the third last epoch if "-epoch latest-2" is specified.<P>

<DT>-epoch all<DD>
Search for profile files in all epochs.<P>

<DT>-epoch &lt;name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the named epoch.  The epoch name should be
the name of a subdirectory corresponding to a single epoch within the
profile database directory.  Epoch subdirectory names usually take
the form <TT>YYMMDDHHMM</TT> (year-month-day-hours-minutes).  For example,
an epoch started on December 4, 1996 at 23:34 is named <TT>9612042334</TT>.
If an epoch is given a symbolic name by creating a symbol link to
the actual epoch directory, then the symbolic name can also be used
as an argument to the <TT>-epoch</TT> option.<P>

<DT>-events all<DD>
Search for profile files corresponding to all event types such as
cycles, icache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-events type(+type)*<DD>
Search for profiles files for the specified event types.  For example,
search for cycles, icache misses, and data cache misses when the
option <TT>-events cycles+imiss+dmiss</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-events all(-type)*<DD>
Search for profile files for all event types except for the specified
types.  For example, search for all event types except for branch
mispredictions when the option <TT>-events all-branchmp</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-label &lt;label&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files with the specified label (see <TT>dcpilabel</TT>).
If no labels are specified on the command line, profile file labels
are ignored entirely.  If any labels are specified on the command line
(this option can be repeated several times), only profile files that
have one of the specified labels are used.<P>

<DT>-profiles &lt;file names...&gt; --<DD>
Use just the profile files named by the specified file names.  The
list of profile file names can be terminated either via <TT>--</TT>, or by
the end of the option list.  The command prints an error message and
fails if the <TT>-profiles</TT> option is used in conjunction with any of
the earlier automatic profile finding options.  (Use either the
automatic profile lookup mechanism, or explicitly name the profile
file with the <TT>-profile</TT> option, but not both.)
</DL>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpilist prints the contents of the procedure specified on the command
line.  The name of the image in which the procedure can be found is
also specified on the command line.  Instead of a procedure name, you
can specify an instruction address: the procedure that contains the
specified address is printed.  If multiple procedures in the image
have the same name, you can give the address of one of these
procedures instead of an ambiguous name.<P>

Dcpilist can print the source code for the procedure, a disassembly of
the procedure, or a mixed output that contains both the source code
and the disassembly.<P>

Each source line and disassebled instruction in the output is
annotated with the sample counts obtained from corresponding profile
files.  When the cycle cost of an instruction or a source line can be
determined (see dcpicalc(1)), then this cost is also printed in the
output.<P>

Samples that do not belong to the specified procedure are ignored.  If
the relevant profile files contain samples for multiple events, then a
column for the count of each unique event type is included in the
listing.  If multiple profile files with the same event type
contribute to the samples for the specified procedure, these samples
are merged together in the output.
