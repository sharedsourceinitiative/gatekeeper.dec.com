dcpi2pix - Translate DIGITAL Continuous Profiling Infrastructure profile data to pixie format
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>SYNOPSIS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>dcpi2pix</B> [&lt;options&gt;] [-scale] [-version] <I>image-file</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpi2pix processes an image file and one or more DIGITAL Continuous
Profiling Infrastructure profiles for that image and produces a
pixie-style output file (*.Counts) containing the relative execution
counts for each basic block in the image.  <P>

The execution counts are estimated from cycles samples using
heuristics as in <A HREF="dcpicalc">dcpicalc(1)</A>.  When a basic block's
estimated execution count has too low a confidence, dcpi2pix
arbitrarily writes a count of 0 for the block in the <TT>Counts</TT> file.
Users will typically want to use the <TT>-conf_low</TT> option to include
low-confidence data.<P>

Before running dcpi2pix, one must gather cycles samples using
<A HREF="dcpid">dcpid(1)</A> and construct a <TT>Addrs</TT> file using
pixie.<P>

Since the Continuous Profiling Infrastructure is a sampling-based
profiling system and pixie produces exact basic block execution counts
through instrumentation, profiles produced by dcpi2pix might confuse
downstream tools.  In particular, if a downstream tool depends on
having exact counter values, with basic block counts that satisfy the
flow constraints of the control flow graph, then it might become
confused when confronted by a dcpi2pix-generated <TT>Counts</TT>, which
will not have this property (see BUGS, below, for an example).  If the
tools use the basic block counts only to determine which parts of the
program were frequently executed, however, the output produced by
dcpi2pix should work fine.<P>

Pixie files contain an embedded CPU type in the profile data.  Dcpi2pix
determines the cpu type using the cpu type of the machine on which the
first specified sample file was gathered.

<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-scale<DD>
By default, an estimated count of 1 denotes P
executions, where P is the average sampling period used to gather the
cycles samples.  With -scale, the estimated basic-block counts are
scaled by P.<P>

<DT>-version<DD>
Print dcpi2pix version string.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>EXECUTION COUNT AND STALL ANALYSIS FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The following options can be used to control the heuristics for estimating
execution counts and identifying the causes of stalls.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-conf_low<DD>  Generate low, medium, and high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-conf_med<DD>  Generate medium and high confidence data. (default)<P>

<DT>-conf_high<DD> Generate only high confidence data.<P>

<DT>-cross_procedure [optimistic | pessimistic | selective]<DD> Choose what
assumption to make when a procedure call boundary is encountered while
looking for reasons to explain dynamic stalls.  A procedure call boundary
is either a call made by the procedure being analyzed or the beginning or
end of that procedure.  With <I>pessimistic</I>, assume that
whatever happens outside the analyzed procedure can cause a dynamic stall
inside it.  With <I>optimistic</I>, assume that it cannot.  With
<I>selective</I>, the assumption is based on standard procedure call
convention.  (The default is <I>optimistic</I>.)<P>

<DT>-do_gp<DD> Use a (non-linear time) constraint solver to exploit global
flow constraints when estimating execution counts.  The 
estimates may still violate flow constraints.<P>

<DT>-tab foo.tab<DD> Get execution counts from output of
<A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> instead of making estimates, which may be
inaccurate.  Requires a .xct file.<P>

<DT>-xct foo.xct<DD> Get execution counts from output of
<A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> instead of making estimates, which may be
inaccurate.  Requires a .tab file.<P>

<DT>-xct_factor num<DD> Scales counts from .xct files by num.  Useful when
you run a program once under <A HREF="dcpix.html">dcpix(1)</A> but multiple (num)
times under <A HREF="dcpid.html">dcpid(1)</A> to get more samples.  Used in
conjuction with -tab and -xct.<P>

</DL>

<H3>PROFILE FILE FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By default, this command automatically finds all of the relevant
profile files.  The following options can be used to guide the search
for the profile files.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-db &lt;directory name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the specified profile database directory.
The directory name should be the same name as the one specified when
<TT>dcpid</TT> was started.  I.e., the named directory should contain a
set of epochs.  If this option is not specified, the directory name is
obtained from the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable.  If neither this
option, nor the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable are set, the name of
the directory used by the last invocation of <TT>dcpid</TT> on this
machine is used.  If none of these methods succeed in finding the
appropriate directory, and no explicit set of profile files is
provided via the <TT>-profiles</TT> option, then the command fails.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest<DD>
Search for profile files in the latest epoch.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest-k<DD>
Search for profile files in the "k+1"th oldest epoch.  For example,
search in the third last epoch if "-epoch latest-2" is specified.<P>

<DT>-epoch all<DD>
Search for profile files in all epochs.<P>

<DT>-epoch &lt;name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the named epoch.  The epoch name should be
the name of a subdirectory corresponding to a single epoch within the
profile database directory.  Epoch subdirectory names usually take
the form <TT>YYMMDDHHMM</TT> (year-month-day-hours-minutes).  For example,
an epoch started on December 4, 1996 at 23:34 is named <TT>9612042334</TT>.
If an epoch is given a symbolic name by creating a symbol link to
the actual epoch directory, then the symbolic name can also be used
as an argument to the <TT>-epoch</TT> option.<P>

<DT>-events all<DD>
Search for profile files corresponding to all event types such as
cycles, icache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-events type(+type)*<DD>
Search for profiles files for the specified event types.  For example,
search for cycles, icache misses, and data cache misses when the
option <TT>-events cycles+imiss+dmiss</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-events all(-type)*<DD>
Search for profile files for all event types except for the specified
types.  For example, search for all event types except for branch
mispredictions when the option <TT>-events all-branchmp</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-label &lt;label&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files with the specified label (see <TT>dcpilabel</TT>).
If no labels are specified on the command line, profile file labels
are ignored entirely.  If any labels are specified on the command line
(this option can be repeated several times), only profile files that
have one of the specified labels are used.<P>

<DT>-profiles &lt;file names...&gt; --<DD>
Use just the profile files named by the specified file names.  The
list of profile file names can be terminated either via <TT>--</TT>, or by
the end of the option list.  The command prints an error message and
fails if the <TT>-profiles</TT> option is used in conjunction with any of
the earlier automatic profile finding options.  (Use either the
automatic profile lookup mechanism, or explicitly name the profile
file with the <TT>-profile</TT> option, but not both.)

<H3>BUGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Using pixstats(1) with profiles generated by dcpi2pix is known to give
incorrect procedure-level information.  Pixstats relies on having
exact basic-block counts and only checks to see if a basic block
starts a new procedure when the basic block's count is bigger than 0.
If the entry basic block for a procedure does not accrue any samples
during profiling using the Continuous Profiling Infrastructure, then
the basic block's effects will be incorrectly attributed to a previous
procedure in the image.

<DL>

<DT><TT>pixie</TT> <I>image</I><DD>
Run pixie(1) over executable <I>image</I>, producing the file
<I>image</I><TT>.Addrs</TT> containing the address of each basic block in
<I>image</I>, and the pixified executable file <I>image</I>.pixie.  The

<DT><TT>dcpi2pix</TT> -conf_low <I>image</I> -db db<DD>
Run dcpi2pix over executable <I>image</I> and cycles samples in <I>db</I>,
producing the pixie-format file <I>image</I><TT>.Counts</TT>.  Note that
dcpi2pix automatically loads the <I>image</I><TT>.Addrs</TT> file generated
by pixie.<P>

<DT><TT>pixstats</TT> <I>image</I><DD>
