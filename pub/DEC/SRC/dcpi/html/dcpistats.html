<H3>FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>-v<DD> Verbose.  Print out additional information.<P>

<DT>-i<DD> Calculate statistics per image.  The default is per procedure.<P>

<DT>-event name<DD>
Print statistics for the named event type.  The default is cycles.<P>

<DT>-keep percentage<DD>
List just enough top procedures to account for the top <I>p</I> percent
of the total samples of the event type.  The value <I>p</I> may be a
floating point number in the range <TT>[0..100]</TT>.<P>

<DT>-range percentage<DD> 
Do not print a procedure (or image) if its normalized range is less
than <I>p</I> percent.  The value <I>p</I> may be a floating point number
in the range <TT>[0..100]</TT>.<P>

<DT>-p image-file-name<DD>
Use the specified image file as a candidate when associating profiles
with named image files.  This option can be repeated, allowing several
image names to be specified on the command line.<P>

<DT>-m map-file-name<DD>
Use specified map file generated by <A HREF="dcpiscan.html">dcpiscan(1)</A>
for associating profiles with named images.  This option can be
repeated, allowing several map files to be specified; information from
all of the supplied map files is merged.  The <TT>-m</TT> option works
like the <TT>-p</TT> option, except that instead of specifying one image
at a time, a whole set of images can be entered into a map file via
<A HREF="dcpiscan.html">dcpiscan(1)</A> and the entire set can be specified
with one command line option.  A default map for common Digital Unix
3.2 and 4.0 binaries is compiled into dcpid; specifying additional
maps will allow dcpistats to find site-specific binaries.<P>

<DT>-set<DD>
Denote the start of a set of sample files.  All samples within a set
are combined, and samples across different sets are compared.<P>

<DT>-factor n<DD> 
Scale the samples in the set by <I>n</I>.  The sample counts in the set
are multiplied by <I>n</I>.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>PROFILE FILE FLAGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

By default, this command automatically finds all of the relevant
profile files.  The following options can be used to guide the search
for the profile files.<P>

<DL>
<DT>-db &lt;directory name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the specified profile database directory.
The directory name should be the same name as the one specified when
<TT>dcpid</TT> was started.  I.e., the named directory should contain a
set of epochs.  If this option is not specified, the directory name is
obtained from the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable.  If neither this
option, nor the <TT>DCPIDB</TT> environment variable are set, the name of
the directory used by the last invocation of <TT>dcpid</TT> on this
machine is used.  If none of these methods succeed in finding the
appropriate directory, and no explicit set of profile files is
provided via the <TT>-profiles</TT> option, then the command fails.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest<DD>
Search for profile files in the latest epoch.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-epoch latest-k<DD>
Search for profile files in the "k+1"th oldest epoch.  For example,
search in the third last epoch if "-epoch latest-2" is specified.<P>

<DT>-epoch all<DD>
Search for profile files in all epochs.<P>

<DT>-epoch &lt;name&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files in the named epoch.  The epoch name should be
the name of a subdirectory corresponding to a single epoch within the
profile database directory.  Epoch subdirectory names usually take
the form <TT>YYMMDDHHMM</TT> (year-month-day-hours-minutes).  For example,
an epoch started on December 4, 1996 at 23:34 is named <TT>9612042334</TT>.
If an epoch is given a symbolic name by creating a symbol link to
the actual epoch directory, then the symbolic name can also be used
as an argument to the <TT>-epoch</TT> option.<P>

<DT>-events all<DD>
Search for profile files corresponding to all event types such as
cycles, icache misses, branch mispredictions, etc.  This is the default.<P>

<DT>-events type(+type)*<DD>
Search for profiles files for the specified event types.  For example,
search for cycles, icache misses, and data cache misses when the
option <TT>-events cycles+imiss+dmiss</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-events all(-type)*<DD>
Search for profile files for all event types except for the specified
types.  For example, search for all event types except for branch
mispredictions when the option <TT>-events all-branchmp</TT> is specified.<P>

<DT>-label &lt;label&gt;<DD>
Search for profile files with the specified label (see <TT>dcpilabel</TT>).
If no labels are specified on the command line, profile file labels
are ignored entirely.  If any labels are specified on the command line
(this option can be repeated several times), only profile files that
have one of the specified labels are used.<P>

<DT>-profiles &lt;file names...&gt; --<DD>
Use just the profile files named by the specified file names.  The
list of profile file names can be terminated either via <TT>--</TT>, or by
the end of the option list.  The command prints an error message and
fails if the <TT>-profiles</TT> option is used in conjunction with any of
the earlier automatic profile finding options.  (Use either the
automatic profile lookup mechanism, or explicitly name the profile
file with the <TT>-profile</TT> option, but not both.)

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dcpistats compares sets of raw sample counts and prints various
statistics about them.  It runs <A HREF="dcpiprof.html">dcpiprof(1)</A> for
each set of samples (separated by the <TT>-set</TT> flag), parses the
output and prints the normalized range, mean, min, max and standard
deviation for each procedure (or image) across all sets of samples.
Dcpistats is useful for comparing variations across multiple runs of
the same program, or for comparing differences between slightly
different versions of a program.<P>

The entries are sorted by the normalized range, i.e.  the difference
between the maximum and minimum sample counts over the total number,
expressed as a percentage.  This helps focus attention on the entries
with the largest variations across the sample sets.<P>

The image files can be the same or different across different sets of
samples.  Dcpistats bins the data according to procedure name (or image
name).  If the same procedure name shows up in multiple images, it
will list the different images.

<H3>EXAMPLE USAGE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT><TT>dcpistats -i -set -epoch latest -set -epoch latest-1 -set -epoch latest-2</TT><DD>
Use dcpistats to compare the cycle counts across images for the sample files 
from the last three epochs.<P>

<DT><TT>dcpistats -set -factor 1.5 -epoch latest -set -epoch latest-1</TT><DD>
Use dcpistats to compare two different sets of sample files.  All
sample counts in the first set are multiplied by 1.5.<P>

<DT><TT>dcpistats -keep 95 -range 50 ...</TT><DD>
Stop printing statistics after accounting for 95% of the samples, and 
do not print entries if the normalized range is less than 50%.
