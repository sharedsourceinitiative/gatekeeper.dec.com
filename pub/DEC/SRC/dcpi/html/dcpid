<DT>-t is shorthand for -event<P>

<DD>Selects event types to monitor, and specifies the sampling period for
each event type.  This option can be repeated; each instance of
<TT>-event</TT> specifies a set of event types to monitor using a single
hardware performance counter.  When only one event type is specified,
it is always monitored.  When several event types are specified, they
are time-multiplexed onto the same hardware counter.  <P>

If no <TT>-event</TT> arguments are specified on the command line, the
default is to always monitor <TT>cycles</TT> and <TT>imiss</TT> events using
the default sampling periods.<P>

<P>

The optional event period follows the event type, and has the format
<I>:Mperiod</I>, where <I>M</I> is a period modifier, and <I>period</I> is
the sampling period.  If the event period is omitted, reasonable
defaults are automatically chosen based on the particular event type
and the processor hardware.<P>

The <I>period modifier</I> must be <I>R</I>, denoting a random sampling
interval with a mean equal to <I>period</I> events, or <I>F</I>, denoting
a fixed sampling interval equal to <I>period</I> events.  If omitted,
the default is to use a random sampling interval on hardware that
supports it, or a fixed sampling interval otherwise.<P>

The <I>sampling period</I> specifies how often the event should be
sampled, expressed as a decimal number.  The suffix <I>K</I> can 
be used to scale the specified <I>period</I> by 1024.<P>

The <I>period modifier</I> and <I>period</I> specifications are limited on
the Alpha 21064 processor, which uses a fixed sampling period (65536
for <TT>cycles</TT>, <TT>issues</TT>, and <TT>flow</TT>, and 4096 for the other
events).  Later Alpha processors such as the 21164 have hardware
support for modifying the sampling period and can support arbitrary
fixed periods, as well as randomized periods.  Randomization of the
sampling interval helps avoid undesirable synchronization effects with
periodic code execution.  <I>Caveat:</I> The current driver
implementation restricts the set of valid randomized periods.  For the
<TT>cycles</TT> event, a valid randomized period must have the form (65536
- 2^n).  Future versions of the driver may allow more flexibility.<P>

<B>Examples</B><P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>-event cycles:R63488 -event imiss+dmiss+branchmp</TT><DD>
Always monitor cycle counter events, with a randomized sampling period
whose mean is one sample every 63488 cycles.  In addition, rotate
among gathering <TT>imiss</TT>, <TT>dmiss</TT>, and <TT>branchmp</TT> events,
using the default sampling rates for those events.<P>

<DT><TT>-event cycles:F64K -event imiss+imiss+imiss+dmiss</TT><DD> 
Always sample <TT>cycles</TT> with a fixed period of 65536 (64K) cycles
per sample, and switch between sampling <TT>imiss</TT> events 75% of the
time and <TT>dmiss</TT> events 25% of the time, using the default sampling
rate for those events.  In this example, events are repeated within a
single multiplexing <TT>-event</TT> option, in order to sample one kind of
event more frequently than other kinds of events.
</DL>
<P>

<B>Caveats</B><P>

Alpha performance counter interrupts are not precise for events other
than <TT>cycles</TT> and <TT>dtbmiss</TT>, so a sample for some other event may
not be correctly attributed to the instruction which generated the
event.<P>

There are only a limited number of hardware performance counters (2 on
21064 processors and 3 on 21164 processors), and each counter can only
count a subset of all events. Thus, certain combinations of events
cannot be simultaneously monitored.  Consult the Alpha AXP
Architecture Reference Manual by Sites &amp; Witek, Appendix D, for
detailed information about legal event combinations.<P>

When multiplexing events, the <TT>cycles</TT> event type must always be
monitored, since cycle sample interrupts are used to decide when to
switch to the next multiplexed event type.  This switching interval is
controlled by the <TT>-mux</TT> option (see below).<P>

On the Alpha 21064 processor, <TT>issues</TT> counts the total number of
instruction issues divided by 2, and <TT>nonissues</TT> counts the total
number of nonissues divided by 2.<P>

On the Alpha 21164, the meaning of the "flow" event is altered by
whether the "branchmp" or "pcmp" events are samples at the same time
as the "flow" event: With "branchmp" sampling, "flow" events happen
only at conditional branches.  With "pcmp" sampling, "flow" events
happend only at jsr and ret instructions.  (Simultaneous sampling of
"branchmp" and "pcmp" events is not possible, though multiplexed
sampling of these events is possible.)  <P>

<DT>-mux <I>interval</I><DD>
<DT>-I is shorthand for -mux<P>

<DD>For event multiplexing, switch the events being monitored every
<I>interval</I> occurences of the <TT>cycle</TT> event performance counter
interrupt.  The default multiplexing interval is 10 on Alpha
21164-based machines; i.e. the monitored events will be switched every
10 cycle counter interrupts.<P>

The default multiplexing interval is 100 for Alpha 21064-based
machines.  On the 21064, counter values cannot be read and restored.
During event multiplexing, this means that the counter values are
reset to zero whenever a multiplexing interval expires.  With frequent
time-multiplexed switching, this can result in distortion in the
sampling of events other than cycles.  For this reason, it is
recommended that the multiplexing interval not be set below about 20
for this processor.

<H3>IMAGE ASSOCIATION OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-bypid <I>image</I><DD>
<DT>-i is shorthand for -bypid<DD>
Store separate profiles for each process that loads the specified
executable image.  By default, the profile associated with an
executable image contains aggregate samples for <I>all</I> processes
that execute that image.  This option allows samples to be identified
by process as well as by image.  The filenames for per-process
profiles have the suffix "_hostPID", where host is the local hostname,
and PID is a local process identifier. This option can be repeated to
specify per-process profiling for multiple executable images.<P>

<DT>-map <I>mapfile</I><DD>
<DT>-m is shorthand for -map<DD>
Use specified map file generated by dcpiscan(1) for associating
processes with named images.  This option can be repeated, allowing
several map files to be specified; information from all of the
supplied map files is merged.<P>

A default map for common Digital Unix
3.2 and 4.0 binaries is compiled into dcpid; specifying additional maps
will allow dcpid to identify site-specific binaries.<P>

<DT>-forkid <I>seconds</I><DD>
The modified system loader dcpiloader(5) provides information to dcpid
about image loadmaps for dynamically-loaded processes.  A hook in the 
kernel exec path provides information to dcpid about image loadmaps
for statically-loaded processes.  Unfortunately, there is no
convenient hook for capturing information about processes that are
created via fork(2) which do not subsequently invoke exec(2).<P>

To obtain loadmap information for such forked processes that are
relatively long-lived, periodic scans of system tables are performed
to match unknown forked processes with information known about their
parents.  By default, a scan is performed every 30 seconds.  This
feature can be disabled by specifying a scan period of 0 seconds.<P>

<DT>-unknown<DD>
<DT>-u is shorthand for -unknown<DD>
Store separate per-process profiles for samples that cannot be
associated with any image.  Unknown samples will be stored in profiles
associated with 1MB regions of each process address space; these
"anonymous" profiles are given names of the form <I>hostPID@address</I>.
If this option is not specified, a count of all unknown samples is
stored in a single profile named <I>unknown@host</I>.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>PROFILE DATABASE OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>-epoch<DD>
<DT>-e is shorthand for -epoch<DD>
Use the most recent existing epoch for storing new profiles.  By
default, a new epoch is created each time dcpid is restarted.  New
epochs can also be started using dcpiepoch(1).<P>

<DT>-merge <I>seconds</I><DD>
<DT>-M is shorthand for -merge<DD>
Merge buffered profile samples from dcpid to the non-volatile profile
database every <I>seconds</I> seconds.  Defaults to every 600 seconds 
(10 minutes). 
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>DRIVER OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-flush <I>seconds</I><DD>
<DT>-F is shorthand for -flush<DD>
Flush samples from the performance counter device driver to dcpid
every <I>seconds</I> seconds.  Defaults to every 300 seconds (5 minutes).
Samples are also automatically flushed from the driver to dcpid whenever
remaining driver buffer space is low.<P>

<DT>-hash <I>bytes</I><DD>
<DT>-H is shorthand for -hash<DD>
Specifies the desired size of the driver hash table data structure in bytes.
The default is 262144 (256K bytes).  The driver treats the specified
size as a hint, and may impose additional constraints, such as forcing
the actual size to be a power of two.<P>

<DT>-chunk <I>bytes</I><DD>
<DT>-C is shorthand for -chunk<DD>
Specifies the desired chunk size to use when flushing driver hash
table data structure.  The default is 16384 (16K bytes).  The driver
treats the specified size as a hint, and may impose additional
constraints, such as forcing the actual size to be a power of two.<P>

<DT>-device <I>device</I><DD>
<DT>-d is shorthand for -device<DD>
Use specified performance counter device for collecting raw samples.
Default device is <TT>/dev/pcount0</TT>.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>LOGGING OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-log <I>logfile</I><DD>
<DT>-l is shorthand for -log<DD>
Use specified file for logging warnings, errors, debugging
information, and other messages.  Defaults to <TT>dcpid-host.log</TT> in
the specified profile database directory, where host is the local
hostname.  The log file is written using append mode, so it is safe to
reuse the same log file across dcpid invocations.<P>

Note: the Unix command <I>tail -f</I> is useful for watching the log as
it is written.<P>

<DT>-quiet<DD>
<DT>-q is shorthand for -quiet<DD>
Operate in quiet mode, disabling most message logging.
By default, dcpid logs errors, debugging information, and other
messages to the specified log file. <P>

<DT>-verbose<DD>
<DT>-v is shorthand for -verbose<DD>
Operate in verbose mode, enabling extra message logging.<P>

<DT>-status <I>seconds</I><DD>
<DT>-L is shorthand for -status<DD>
Log dcpid status information to the log file every <I>seconds</I> seconds.  
The default period is 0 (i.e. disabled).<P>

<DT>-logmaps<DD>
<DT>-x is shorthand for -logmaps<DD>
Log image loadmap information as it becomes available.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>OTHER OPTIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>-help<DD>
Print dcpid usage message and then terminate.<P>

<DT>-version<DD>
<DT>-V is shorthand for -version<DD>
Print dcpid version string.<P>

<DT>-bug<DD>
<DT>-b is shorthand for -bug<DD>
Avoid DIGITAL Unix bug by disabling the initial scan of system tables
to identify executables started before dcpid.  This option is provided
to eliminate the possiblity of dcpid triggering kernel bugs that can
hand dcpid or even crash the kernel in rare cases.<P>

Unlike earlier versions of dcpid, which performed frequent scans to
identify images, the current version only performs a single scan
during initialization.  Thus, it is extremely unlikely that this
problem will be encountered.  It is generally worth the risk of
performing the initial scan in order to obtain useful information about
processes that were already executing when dcpid was started.<P>

When -bug is specified, periodic scans for identifying forked images
are also disabled.  This is merely a precaution, since there are no
reports of problems with -forkid scans.<P>

<DT>-nodaemon<DD>
<DT>-D is shorthand for -nodaemon<DD>
Do not run dcpid as a daemon.  By default, dcpid places itself in
the background, detaches from its terminal, and redirects all output
to its log file.<P>

<DT>-socket <I>socket</I><DD>
<DT>-s is shorthand for -socket<DD>
Use specified local Unix socket pathname for incoming messages from
client applications such as dcpiflush(1), dcpiepoch(1), and
dcpiquit(1).  Defaults to <TT>/tmp/.dcpid0</TT>, the default path used by
these client applications and dcpiloader(5).<P>

</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Dcpid continuously extracts raw samples from the specified performance
counter device, associates them with their corresponding images, and
updates disk-based image profiles in the specified profile database.
A new profile database can be created by specifying an empty directory.<P>

Dcpid shuts down gracefully in response to termination signals,
flushing all unsaved samples to their corresponding profiles before
terminating.  Dcpid may also be terminated using dcpiquit(1).<P>

Dcpid must be executed with root privileges.  It is recommended that
dcpid be installed as a setuid-root program.
