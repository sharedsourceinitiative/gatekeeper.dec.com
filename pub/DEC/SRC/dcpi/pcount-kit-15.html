/dev/pcount installation instructions:

Become root and where &lt;config&gt; is the name of your configuration
(usually the name of the machine in all upper-case):

	# cat pcount.tar.Z  | uncompress | tar xvf -
	# cd pcount
	# ./INSTALL &lt;config&gt;

This will put the pcount device driver configuration information into
/sys/conf/.product.list and /sys/conf/&lt;config&gt;.list, if it exists.  If
you are using other third party drivers and have other configurations,
you will have to copy the PCOUNT line from .product.list to the other
&lt;config&gt;.list files.

Build the new kernel:

	# doconfig -c &lt;config&gt;

Test the new kernel:

	# mv /vmunix{,.good}
	# mv /sys/&lt;config&gt;/vmunix /
	# reboot
