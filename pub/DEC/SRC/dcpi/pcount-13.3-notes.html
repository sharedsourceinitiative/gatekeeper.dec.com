Pcount Version 13.3 Release Notes
</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Only one change was made since the previous version:

  - Fixed a bug that could affect the accuracy of event counts when
    multiple event types are multiplexed onto the same performance counter.

/dev/pcount installation instructions:

Become root and where &lt;config&gt; is the name of your configuration
(usually the name of the machine in all upper-case):

	# cat pcount.tar.Z  | uncompress | tar xvf -
	# cd pcount
	# ./INSTALL &lt;config&gt;

This will put the pcount device driver configuration information into
/sys/conf/.product.list and /sys/conf/&lt;config&gt;.list, if it exists.  If
you are using other third party drivers and have other configurations,
you will have to copy the PCOUNT line from .product.list to the other
&lt;config&gt;.list files.

Build the new kernel:

	# doconfig -c &lt;config&gt;

Test the new kernel:

	# mv /vmunix{,.good}
	# mv /sys/&lt;config&gt;/vmunix /
	# reboot
