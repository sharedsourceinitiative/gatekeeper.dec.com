DCPI-V3.4 Release Notes
</h1>

<pre>
Changes since release V3.2:

- Initial support for Alpha 21264* counters; see dcpid man page.

- Dcpid supports a new -nice option to adjust its scheduling priority,
  and a new -gc option to automatically delete old epochs.

<pre>
Changes since release V2.12:

- Pcount driver is dynamically loadable.

- Dcpid loads pcount at startup and unloads it at exit.

- A new underlying profile file format is used to store sample data
  for all events in a single file per image.  Backwards compatibility
  has been retained so that all tools support profiles collected with
  previous versions of DCPI.

- Dcpid supports a new -nice option to adjust its scheduling priority,
  and a new -gc option to automatically delete old epochs.

- Fixed a rare assertion failure in instruction-level analysis tools.

- This version works with Digital Unix T5.0 646.2 (a.k.a. BL17)

- Support for Digital Unix 3.2 has been dropped.  Use DCPI-V2.11 and
  pcount-13.3 build 15 for machines running 3.2.

Changes since release V2.11:

- Added support for Alpha 21066 and other 21064-compatible cpus.

Changes since release V2.10:

- Adds support for compressed kernel modules.

- dcpiprof listings now contain information about which named
  procedure is near an anonymous procedure to help the user in finding
  anonymous procedures.

Changes since release V2.5:

- DCPI releases V2.6 through V2.9 each had incompatibilities
  with various versions of Digital Unix.  We believe that these
  problems have been corrected.
  
- New loader for 4.0c and higher.
  Dynamically linked images can be profiled on machines running
  DU V3.2 or V4.0*, but not V5.0*.  The INSTALL script tests the
  DCPI loader before installing it as the default system loader.

- Minor improvements to dcpid image identification.
  Image maps for common DU V4.0c and V4.0d binaries are compiled into dcpid.
  Fixed identification of large images started before dcpid.

- Major update to dcpi2pix to generate more accurate data.

- Added support for new 21264 instructions.
