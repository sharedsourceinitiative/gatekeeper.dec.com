<pre>
DIGITAL Continuous Profiling Infrastructure
for Windows NT (TM) version V1.4a
Copyright (C) 1996, 1997 DIGITAL Equipment Corporation

**********************************************************
** NOTE:  THE "Error 42" during install has been fixed. **
**********************************************************

This is the README.TXT file for the Windows NT version of DCPI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When upgrading or reinstalling DCPI, it is best to remove the 
old version before installing the new version.  To uninstall
an old release:

    * Stop the DCPI Daemon (DCPISVC).  Use the DCPI control panel, 
      or type "NET STOP DCPISVC" in a command prompt window.

    * Stop the DCPI Driver (CPIDRV).  Use the Windows control panel,
      or type "NET STOP CPIDRV" in a command prompt window.

    * Remove DCPI programs.  Go into the Windows NT Control
      Panel, run "Add/Remove Programs", choose "Digital 
      Continuous Profiling", and then click "Remove."

Now, follow the installation instructions below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* To install DCPI for Windows NT, you will need the following:

    Alpha AXP processor (EV4, EV45, EV5, or EV56)
    Windows NT 4.0 FREE BUILD (any service pack level)
    At least 20MB free disk space
    At least  5MB free memory
    Administrator Privileges on the local system.

    Note: DCPI does not work on the checked build of NT.  We're
          currently investigating this.

* Unpack the kit using PKZIP(tm), WinZIP(tm), or other similar
  archive unacking software.  Run the installation program
  SETUP.EXE which can be found inside the .ZIP file.

  The SETUP utility will ask you where to place the installed
  kit files.  Choose a directory with sufficient space (the
  default is \DCPI on your system disk).  DCPI SETUP will
  install the software, create some program icons for the
  control panel applet and release notes, then ask you to 
  reboot your system to complete the installation of the
  device driver.  By default, the following directory
  tree is created:

	\DCPI		Main directory containing release notes
			and uninstall information.  The 
			DCPI Daemon's log file is created here.
	\DPCI\BIN	Program binaries.  You can add this 
			directory to your search path.
	\DCPI\HELP	HTML files containing online help.
	\DCPI\DB	Database files.

  DCPI for Windows NT is uninstallable by using the NT control
  panel.  Select 'Settings' from the start menu, then 'Control
  Panel', and then 'Add/Remove Programs'.  Choose DCPI from
  the list of installed programs and click "Install/Remove", and
  DCPI will be removed from your system.

* To provide profiles of Kernel code, it is very useful to
  install the symbols to your system disk.  These files
  are usually found on the SUPPORT\DEBUG\SYMBOLS\ALPHA directory
  of the CD, but you may need to obtain them from Microsoft's
  web site if you have installed any of the NT Service Packs.
  To install the symbols, XCOPY the symbol tree to your
  system root:

  XCOPY Q:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\SYMBOLS\ALPHA\*.* %SystemRoot%\SYMBOLS\*.* /S

  Then, add a system-wide environment variable to help DCPI and
  other NT tools find the symbols:

  _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=%SystemRoot%\SYMBOLS

  Environment variables are added by going to the property
  sheet (right button menu) of "My Computer".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting DCPI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Run the DCPI "control panel" applet (DCPICPL.EXE) and select
  the events you want to monitor, and any other options for the
  daemon (you'll notice they are very similar to the Unix version).

  Note that you can select more than one event per counter.  If
  you do this, DCPI will "multiplex" the different events,
  reducing the effective sampling rate for the counter.
  If you multiplex events, counter #0 must always be set
  to measure 'cycles', since the cycle counter interrupts are
  used to control the multiplexing of the other counters.

  When you click OK to exit the dialog, these options will be saved
  in the registry.

* After selecting the counters and other options, go to the
  'Start' tab in the control panel and press the "Start Sampling"
  button.  The NT Service Control Manager should then start the
  DCPI Daemon.  As an alternative, you can start and stop DCPI
  from the Command Prompt window by using the "NET START DCPISVC"
  and "NET STOP DCPISVC" commands.

* To view the log file, stop the sampling process and press the
  "View Log" button on the 'Start' tab in the control panel.

* It is possible to start DCPISVC as a console application.  This
  can be useful if you wish to run the service in the foreground
  and specify the options as command-line parameters.  To start
  DPCISVC in the foreground, use the following command:

     dcpisvc -console <... dcpid parameters, same as Unix ...>

  For example, to run the daemon and monitor "cycles" and "imiss"
  events, use the following command:

     dcpisvc -console -t cycles -t imiss c:\dcpi\db

  Note: If you start DCPISVC in this way, you *must* use the
  "dcpiquit" command to shut the daemon down.  It will not
  respond to the control panel applet when started in console mode.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Procedures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once DCPI is running, you can follow these basic procedures to
get an overview of where the time is being spent:

* Run an application whose performance you wish to monitor.  This
  works best on applications that have symbolic information
  in the executable images, but you can use any image.

* On the DCPI Control Panel, press the "Flush Samples" button,
  or run the "dcpiflush" command.  This command extracts any
  unread samples from the driver and merges them with the profiles
  already stored on the disk.

* Use the command "DCPIPROF -i" to get a listing of active images
  and the total samples collected for each image.

* Use the command "DCPIPROF <image-name>" to get a list of procedures
  within the image and the sample counts for each procedure.

* Use the command "DCPILIST -asm -p <procedure-name> <image-name>"
  to display a disassembled procedure with sample counts and calculated
  CPI information for each instruction in a procedure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DCPI Utilities Included
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following DCPI utilities have been ported to Windows NT:

     dcpisvc
	   Continuous profiling daemon.  Extracts raw samples from kernel
           device driver, associates them with executable images, and stores
           them in profiles on disk.  This service can be started
	   and stopped from the control panel, or by typing
	   "net start|stop dcpisvc"

     dcpiprof
           Analyzes profile data collected by dcpisvc.  Produces a 
           breakdown of cpu time by image, or by procedures within images.

     dcpilist
           List the contents of a procedure and annotate the listing with
           samples collected during profiling via dcpid.  The listing can
           contain either machine instructions, or source lines, or both.
           The listing is annotated with the samples collected during
           profiling, as well as the average number of cycles required to
           execute each instruction or source line.

     dcpicalc
           Annotates each instruction in a procedure's basic-block graph with
           the average number of cycles for that instruction, and computes
           the overall average cycle-per-instruction for that procedure.

     dcpix Measure execution frequencies for basic blocks and control-flow
           edges directly; output can be used by dcpicalc instead of
           estimating frequencies from sample counts.

     dcpisumxct
           Aggregates execution counts measured using dcpix from multiple
           runs of an instrumented program.  This makes it possible for
           dcpicalc to analyze counts from multiple runs of a program.

     dcpiwhatcg
           Produces a program-level summary breakdown of where time has been
           spent (percent of cycles spent in, e.g., memory delays, static
           stalls, branch mispredicts, and useful execution).

     dcpidiff
           Compares two sets of profiles for a procedure, highlighting basic
           blocks or source lines with the largest differences.

     dcpi2ps
           Formats a basic-block graph into Postscript.

     dcpictl
           Controls the operation of dcpid.  This subsumes dcpiepoch,
           dcpiflush, and dcpiquit (which are still provided for backward
           compatibility).  Adds functionality to tell the daemon about
           specific images loaded into processes when necessary (e.g., when
           an image is loaded via mmap).

     dcpiepoch
           Starts a new profiling epoch.  All samples are associated with a
           time interval called an epoch.  The analysis tools typically
           operate on a set of profiles from a single epoch.

     dcpiflush
           Flushes all unsaved samples from dcpid to profiles on disk.

     dcpiquit
           Terminates the dcpid daemon, flushing all unsaved samples to disk.

     dcpiscan
           Scans filesystem directories to find executables and associate
           executables with filesystem pathnames.

     dcpicat
           Prints the contents of one or more profile files in an ASCII
           format.

     dcpiflow
           Generates a basic-block graph for a procedure annotated with
           samples collected during profiling via dcpid.  The functionality
           of this program has been subsumed by dcpicalc.

     dcpidis
           Disassembles a procedure and annotates the disassembly with
           samples collected during profiling via dcpid.  This program is
           obsolete.  Use dcpilist instead.


The following DCPI commands are available on Digital Unix
but not on Windows NT:


     dcpistats
           Compares multiple sets of raw sample counts and prints various
           statistics about them.  Dcpistats is useful for comparing
           variations across multiple runs of the same program, or for
           comparing differences between slightly different versions of a
           program.

           Status: This is currently implemented as a shell script on Unix.

     dcpisource
           Augments a basic-block graph generated by dcpiflow with source
           code.

           Status: This is currently implemented as a shell script on Unix.
     dcpicc
           Compiles C programs to produce object code that helps dcpisource
           in identifying which source token each instruction corresponds to.

           Status: This is currently implemented as a shell script on Unix.

     dcpiversion
           Print the version string and creation date of the installed
           DIGITAL continuous profiling release.

           Status: This is currently implemented as a shell script on Unix.

     dcpiuninstall
           Uninstalls DCPI binaries and man pages, and restores the original
           version of /sbin/loader.

           Status: Use the Windows NT Control Panel's "Add/Remove Programs" 
           icon to remove DCPI for Windows NT.

     dcpiloader
           A modified version of the standard dynamic loader that provides
           dcpid with information about where executables are loaded.

           Status: The "modified loader" is implemented in the device
           driver on Windows NT.

     dcpi2pix
           Converts DCPI profile data to pixie format.

     dcpikdiff
           Creates a new image based on both vmunix and kmem(7) that captures
           the true running kernel image after Digital Unix dynamically
           patches itself using self-modifying code.

The following additional files are part of this kit:

      CPILIB.DLL	Access library for CPIDRV driver
      CPIDRV.SYS	Performance counter driver
      README.TXT	This file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS FIXED IN THIS RELEASE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The device driver would not correctly program the CPU's 
  counter registers for certain events on EV5 (21164) processors.

  The affected events are the external "mux" events on 
  counters 1 and 2.

  This has been corrected, all events are correctly programmed
  into the CPU's registers.
  
* DCPI will now read CodeView symbols from image files via the
  IMAGEHLP library supplied with Windows NT. 

* Numerous improvements have been made to the device driver,
  improving its efficiency.

* PCA56 (21165) machines are now supported.

* You can start the daemon as a console application (similar
  to the way the Unix version does) by using the "dcpisvc -console"
  command.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAVEATS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The install procedure does not place the DCPI tools on the path.
  You can do this yourself by going to 'Properties' on 'My Computer',
  selecting "Environment", and adding the install directory to the path.

* On some occasions, InstallSHIELD fails to create the program group
  icons for the DCPI control panel and help files.  Installing DCPI
  a second time will usually fix this.

* If you want to set DCPISVC to 'Automatic' to start it at
  system boot time, we advise you to create a separate
  boot configuration that does NOT include DCPISVC.
  NT will prompt you to select a boot configuration
  at startup time.

* Profiles for images loaded after the daemon starts are
  likely to be stored as "unknown..." in the database.  The
  image IDs are correct, however, so the tools should be able
  to find them in most cases. 

* Occasionally, when stopping the DCPI Daemon, the service control
  manager will report that the daemon is not responding to the 
  control function.  DCPISVC does a flush before it shuts down,
  and the flush can often take long enough that the service control
  manager thinks the daemon has gone away.  

* The DCPI Control Panel is not very smart about what events
  can/should be multiplexed with others.  In particular,
  it currently does not ensure that 'cycles' is selected
  on counter 0 if multiplexing is happening on the other
  counters.

* Don't try to uninstall the software while it is running,
  do 'NET STOP DCPISVC' and 'NET STOP CPIDRV'  before running 
  the uninstall procedure.

* If you include only CodeView information in your executables,
  DCPI will not be able to display source file information, since
  COFF is still used for matching source files with code.

* "Stripped" COFF symbols are supported, provided the DCPI tools
  can find the symbol files (.DBG) in the same directory as the
  executable, along _NT_SYMBOL_PATH, or along the regular search PATH.
