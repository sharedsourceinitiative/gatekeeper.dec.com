DCPI-V2.3 Release Notes
</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
Changes since release V2.2:

- dcpid
  - Added support for labelled profiles (see new dcpilabel command).
  - Added support for classifying samples from dynamically-loaded
    kernel modules. 
  - Added support to identify "forked without exec" images (see new
    -forkid option). 
  - Added support for all non-external events on 21064 and 21164
    processors. 
  - Changed default log file name and location (see -log option).
  - Status logging is now disabled by default (see -status option).
  - Fixed a bug in sampling of bmiss events (was sampling something
    else). 
  - Fixed minor bugs that could occasionally misclassify samples as
    "unknown". 

- dcpilabel - new command
  - It runs a specified program and labels all collected profiles with a
    user-defined label.  This label can be passed to analysis tools to
    focus their attention on just the profiles with the specified label.
    This functionality can be used for example to compare two runs of a
    program within the same epoch, or to find the samples that fall within
    the kernel during the run of a program.

- dcpitopstalls - new command
  - It lists the stall instructions in one or more images sorted in
    descending order of the cycles they take.

- dcpiwhatcg
  - Added support for examining multiple images
  - Improved performance for images with a lot of unexecuted code

- dcpicalc
  - It now identifies "nops" in procedure summary and instruction listing
  - It now chooses a font size for each basic blocks based on its importance
  - It now omits the bodies of basic blocks that take trivial amounts of
    time.  See -cutoff option for details.
  - Improved heuristics for finding possible reasons for stalls

- dcpicalc, dcpiwhatcg, dcpitopstalls, dcpilist
  - Improved frequency estimates


See man pages for details on these changes.
