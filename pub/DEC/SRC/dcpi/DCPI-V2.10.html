DCPI-V2.10 Release Notes
</h1>
<pre>
Changes since release V2.5:

- DCPI releases V2.6 through V2.9 each had incompatibilities
  with various versions of Digital Unix.  We believe that these
  problems have been corrected, and would appreciate your help
  in testing out V2.10: please send mail to dcpi-bugs@pa.dec.com
  and let us know whether or not V2.10 worked on your system, and
  include the output of the command "uname -a" to identify the
  version of Digital Unix on your machine.  We apologize for any
  inconvenience that our earlier releases may have caused.
  
- New loader for 4.0c and higher.
  Dynamically linked images can be profiled on machines running
  DU V3.2 or V4.0*, but not V5.0*.  The INSTALL script tests the
  DCPI loader before installing it as the default system loader.

- Minor improvements to dcpid image identification.
  Image maps for common DU V4.0c and V4.0d binaries are compiled into dcpid.
  Fixed identification of large images started before dcpid.

- Major update to dcpi2pix to generate more accurate data.

- Added support for new 21264 instructions.
