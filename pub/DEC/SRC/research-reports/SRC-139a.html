<h2>Abstract</h2>

<b>This report describes WebCard, an integrated mail/news reader and Web
browser.  As a mail/news reader, WebCard is fairly conventional; the
innovation is that Web pages are fully integrated into the mail/news
reader. The user interface is based on folders, which can contain mail
messages, news articles or Web pages.  Folders can be used to organize
material and to present the pages returned by commands such as
"search" and "auto surf."</b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

As people are spending increasing amounts of time processing e-mail,
reading news, and surfing the Web, an integrated user
interface to these three activities becomes increasingly appealing.<p>

Leading-edge Web browsers are moving toward this goal by including
features for handling e-mail and newsgroups.  For instance, Netscape
Navigator includes both a mail reader and a news reader. However, each
reader appears in a separate top-level window, and the readers are
only loosely integrated with the Web browser: the only connection to
the Web browser is that when a mail message or news article contains a
URL, the URL is "active." That is, the user can click on the URL,
causing Navigator to fetch the page and display it in its Web browser
window.
<p>

Leading-edge mail and news readers are also moving toward this goal by
making URLs in messages active and by allowing mail messages and news
articles to reference Web pages as MIME attachments. As a MIME
attachment, the text part of the mail message or news article is shown
in the standard fashion, and clicking on the "attachment" button
invokes an external Web browser that displays the attached Web
page. Once the Web browser is running, however, it is completely
independent of the mail or news reader that invoked it.
<p>

This report describes WebCard, a mail/news reader (think of it as a
combination of <code>xmh</code> and <code>xrn</code>) that has been enhanced to
handle Web pages <i>using the same interface that is already used
for handling mail messages and news articles</i>.  The user interface is
based on folders, which can contain mail messages, news articles, and
also Web pages.  The obvious use of folders is for organizing
material, as is done in conventional e-mail and news readers using
folders, and in Web browsers using bookmarks or hotlists.
In WebCard, however, folders can contain an arbitrary mix of mail
messages, news articles, and Web pages. WebCard also uses folders to
present the mail messages, news articles, and Web pages returned by
the "search" command, and to present the Web pages returned by the
"auto surf" command.
<p>

WebCard was made available to the SRC community in the spring of
1995. At that time, no other system existed that provided integrated
e-mail, news, and Web browsing. (In fact, at that time, Navigator
could send, but not receive e-mail, and could read, but not post to
newsgroups.)  Two systems have recently been announced that appear to
integrate e-mail and news with Web browsing much like WebCard:
Cyberdog <a href="#cyberdog">[2]</a> from Apple and the Other
Browser <a href="#theother">[7]</a> from Pixelogic.
<p>

<h2>WebCard</h2>

At first blush, WebCard is a conventional folder-based e-mail reader.
The user interface (see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) is divided into three regions: a <i>table of
contents</i> at the top left, a <i>list of folders</i> at the top
right, and a <i>display pane</i> at the bottom. The list of folders
shows the folders belonging to the user. There are two distinguished
folders: the <i>selected folder</i> and the <i>open folder</i>.
Single-clicking a folder selects it, thereby making it the target of
move and copy operations. Double-clicking both selects and opens a
folder. Each message in the open folder is summarized by a line in the 
table of contents, containing a message number, the date the
message was sent, the sender of the message, and the subject.
<p>

At any given time one message from the open folder, called the <i>selected message</i>, is shown in the display pane of the WebCard
window.  The corresponding line in the table of contents is
highlighted.  Clicking on a different line, or using the up and down
arrow buttons, changes the selected message.  The user can respond to the
selected message, forward it, copy or move it to the selected folder, and
so on. (Actually, more than one message can be selected, but some
operations, like "Reply," are only valid when there is a single
selected message.) Users can also perform standard folder operations,
such as creating, renaming, and deleting folders. 
<p>

WebCard handles newsgroups in the same way: a folder whose name refers
to a newsgroup contains the articles in that group. Users can
respond to a news article, copy articles
to the selected folder, and so on. The primary difference between a newsgroup folder
and any other folder is that newsgroup folders are read-only:
users cannot delete messages from, or copy messages into,
a newsgroup folder. \linebreak WebCard uses the name of the folder to distinguish
between newsgroup folders and ordinary folders; a period in the folder
name indicates a newsgroup.  The Andrew Messages System <a href="#ams">[1]</a> is
the only non-Web browser we know of that deals uniformly with
e-mail and newsgroups.
<p>

WebCard is also a Web browser: Web pages are displayed in the display
pane that normally shows the contents of a message.  There are three
ways to bring up a Web page: by clicking on a URL that appears in the
currently selected mail message or news article (see <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>); by
typing the URL into a dialog box that is opened by left-clicking the
"WWW" button; and by selecting a URL in an arbitrary window (e.g.,
by highlighting it with the mouse) and then middle-clicking the
"WWW" button.  Once a Web page is displayed, clicking on a link
fetches the associated page, which then replaces the existing page in
WebCard's display pane.
<p>

Whenever WebCard displays a Web page, the menu bar displayed at the
top of the display pane changes to contain "Back," "Forward," and
"Stop" buttons, and a pull-down menu labeled "WWW."  The "Back"
and "Forward" buttons traverse the chain of Web pages that have been
visited. For instance, when the screen dump was captured in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>,
a total of sixteen Web pages had been visited, and the user issued the
"Back" command twice. The "Stop" button cancels any retrievals in
progress, and the "WWW" menu contains a variety of Web-oriented
commands, such as "Auto Surf," described later.
<p>

The Web page currently displayed in the display pane can be added to
the selected folder.  When a page is added to a folder, the folder's
table of contents shows an entry for the page. The date field is
the date the page was added to the folder; the URL of the Web page is
shown in place of the sender field of mail messages, and the Web
page's title replaces the subject field.
<p>

Once in a folder, Web pages can be moved or copied to another folder
just like any mail message or news article. The only mail/news
operation that doesn't make sense for a Web page is "Reply."
<p>

Folders provide a convenient way for users to organize material.
For example, a user can keep
the home pages of all his or her colleagues together in a folder named
"Colleagues," or keep all pages, news articles, and e-mail messages
about the Boston Red Sox in a folder named "Bosox." The advantage of
WebCard folders over bookmarks in conventional Web browsers is that
WebCard folders can also contain mail messages and news articles.  And
the advantage of WebCard folders over folders in conventional email or
news readers is that WebCard folders can also contain Web pages.
<p>

WebCard uses folders to return the results of certain operations.
For example, the search command creates a new folder containing all
items in the open folder that contain a specified string. A more
innovative use of folders is for the "Auto Surf" command, which
traverses every link on a particular Web page and returns all resulting
pages in a new folder (see
<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). The retrieved pages can be traversed
conveniently just by clicking on the up and down arrow buttons. The functionality of the "Auto Surf" command is
now available in a variety of "offline Web browsers," such as Open
Market's OM-Express <a href="#om-express">[6]</a>.
<p>

WebCard allows users to detach the display pane, making it a separate
pane (called a <i>detached pane</i>) in the WebCard window and causing
a new display pane to appear. Detached panes can be deleted when no
longer needed, and there can be an arbitrary number of them. This feature allows a page to remain visible for an extended
period of time, even while following another chain of links in the
display pane. This use of detached panes is similar to opening a new
Web browser window in conventional browsers.
<p>

Another use of detached panes is to make it easier to explore lists of
links, often found on home pages (see <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>). When
clicking a link in the detached pane, the new Web page appears back on
the display pane rather than obscuring the item in the detached
pane. Without a
detached pane, the user would need to issue the "Back" command after
each link was visited.  Netscape's frames are often used to achieve
this same goal.  The advantage of WebCard's approach is that the user, not
the content provider, is in control. That is, the user can choose to
detach <i>any</i> page and can decide when to remove it.
<p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

WebCard is implemented in Modula-3 <a href="#modula3">[5]</a>, and makes use of
two existing Modula-3 applications, Postcard and DeckScape. Postcard
is a folder-based mail/news reader that has been in daily use at SRC
since 1988.  DeckScap <a href="#deckscape">[3]</a> is an experimental Web browser
based on the metaphor of a <i>deck</i>, a collection of Web pages, only
one of which is visible at a time. The DeckScape display consists of
multiple decks, all in a single top-level window. Users can move,
resize or iconify decks, move or copy pages between decks, and so
on. Decks in DeckScape serve the function of folders in WebCard.
DeckScape pioneered detached pages and auto surfing in Web browsers.

<h2>Status</h2>

WebCard is a prototype and does not support many of the advanced HTML
features that users expect of Web browsers, such as forms, tables, 
Java applets (however, WebCard does support <i>distributed applets</i>
written in Obliq <a href="#oblets">[4]</a>), and so on. WebCard also does not
support many of the features that advanced mail/news readers provide,
such as MIME attachments and threaded discussions. The source code is
part of the standard Modula-3 release.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

WebCard integrates e-mail, news, and Web browsing into a single user
interface, thereby avoiding the context-switching inherent to using
independent applications. WebCard supports folders, a flexible way to
organize, browse, and store large numbers of documents --- e-mail
messages, news articles, and Web pages.
<p>

We do not claim that WebCard is <i>the</i> correct way to browse the
Web, to organize material on the Web, to integrate mail and news, or
even to integrate mail/news with Web browsing.  Discovering and
quantifying the strengths and weaknesses of the approach introduced by
WebCard are challenges for the future.

"Zippers." The selected message, seen in the display pane, contains
two URLs: one refers to the Zeus home page and the other to the
sender's home page.

<b>Figure 3.</b>
This screen dump is the result of issuing the "Auto Surf"
command from the Zeus home page in Figure 2.  The links are retrieved
and stored in the folder named "--Surf--", which is automatically
opened after issuing the command. Thus, all links on the Zeus home
page can be explored by simply using the up and down arrow keys to
change the selected message.

<b>Figure 4.</b>
This screen dump is the result of clicking on the "Detach"
button when viewing the Zeus home page in Figure 2. The WebCard window
now has a display pane (middle) and a detached pane (bottom).
Initially, the display pane and the detached pane both show the same
page.  Clicking on links in either pane will cause a new page to be
displayed in the display pane. In particular, because clicking on
links in the detached page does not obscure the page, a typical use of
detached panes is for displaying an index page (e.g., a home page)
with many links.

This screen dump is the result of scrolling the page in the
detached pane (bottom) in Figure 4, and then clicking on the leftmost
