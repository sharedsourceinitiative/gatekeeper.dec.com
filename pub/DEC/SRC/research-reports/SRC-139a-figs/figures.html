</th>
<td>
<a name="figure1"><b>Figure 1.</b></a> 
This screen dump shows WebCard displaying the author's
inbox. The open folder is "inbox," and the selected folder is
"Zippers." The selected message, seen in the display pane, contains
two URLs: one refers to the Zeus home page and the other to the
sender's home page.

<tr>
<th>
<a href="fig2.gif"><img align=middle src="fig2-small.gif"></a>
</th>
<td>
<a name="figure2"><b>Figure 2.</b></a> 
This screen dump is the result of clicking on the URL referring
to the Zeus home page in the e-mail message shown in Figure 1.
</td>

<tr>
<th>
<a href="fig3.gif"><img align=middle src="fig3-small.gif"></a>
</th>
<td>
<a name="figure3"><b>Figure 3.</b></a> 
This screen dump is the result of issuing the "Auto Surf"
command from the Zeus home page in Figure 2.  The links are retrieved
and stored in the folder named "--Surf--", which is automatically
opened after issuing the command. Thus, all links on the Zeus home
page can be explored by simply using the up and down arrow keys to
change the selected message.
</td>

<tr>
<th>
<a href="fig4.gif"><img align=middle src="fig4-small.gif"></a>
</th>
<td>
<a name="figure4"><b>Figure 4.</b></a> 
This screen dump is the result of clicking on the "Detach"
button when viewing the Zeus home page in Figure 2. The WebCard window
now has a display pane (middle) and a detached pane (bottom).
Initially, the display pane and the detached pane both show the same
page.  Clicking on links in either pane will cause a new page to be
displayed in the display pane. In particular, because clicking on
links in the detached page does not obscure the page, a typical use of
detached panes is for displaying an index page (e.g., a home page)
with many links.

<tr>
<th>
<a href="fig5.gif"><img align=middle src="fig5-small.gif"></a>
</th>
<td>
<a name="figure5"><b>Figure 5.</b></a> 
This screen dump is the result of scrolling the page in the
detached pane (bottom) in Figure 4, and then clicking on the leftmost
icon. The new page is retrieved and displayed in the display pane
(middle).
