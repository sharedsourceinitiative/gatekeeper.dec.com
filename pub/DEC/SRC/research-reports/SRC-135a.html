<DD>
This paper describes DeckScape, an experimental
World-Wide Web browser based on a "deck" metaphor.  A
deck consists of a collection of Web pages, and
multiple decks can exist on the screen at once.  As
the user traverses links, new pages appear on top of
the current deck.  Retrievals are done using a
background thread, so all visible pages in any deck
are active at all times.  Users can move and copy
pages between decks, and decks can be used as a
general-purpose way to organize material, such as
hotlists, query results, and breadth-first expansions.

<H2>Overview</H2>

Mosaic <A HREF=#REF-mosaic>[1]</A> and the various
Web browsers it has inspired <A HREF=#REF-faq>[5]</A>
<A HREF=#REF-browsers>[6]</A>, use a depth-first
navigational model.  At any point in time, the user
is "at" a particular node on the Web, having arrived
there by following a path of nodes from some root.
The user can choose to leave the current node either
by following an outgoing link or by going back to the
previous node in the path from the root.  After going
back, the user can also choose to go forward to the
next node on the most recent path from the root.

<P> Most Mosaic-inspired browsers support other navigation
methods in addition to these primitives; for instance, the
user can jump to different URLs using the "Hotlist" and
"Open URL" dialogs.  Most browsers also offer multiple open
windows, each with its own depth-first visitation stack.
However, with the exception of Netscape <A
HREF=#REF-netscape>[4]</A> and InternetWorks <A
HREF=#REF-internetworks>[3]</A>, the browsers are
single-threaded, so while one window is downloading a page,
all of the windows owned by the browser become inactive.

<P> We have developed DeckScape, an experimental browser for
exploring new methods of navigating and organizing pages on
the Web.  DeckScape centers on the metaphor of a
<EM>deck</EM>: a collection of Web pages, of which only one
is visible at a time.  When the user clicks a link on a
page, a new Web page appears on top of the deck, obscuring
the page that was previously visible.  The user can leaf
through a deck's pages one at a time, jump to the top or
bottom of a deck, or move to any particular page by
choosing its name from a list of the deck's current
contents.  The browser itself consists of multiple decks,
all in a single top-level window.  Users can move, resize or
iconify decks, move or copy pages between decks, start new
decks, delete decks or pages, and so on.  The contents of
decks persist between invocations of DeckScape.

<P> The key benefit of the deck abstraction is that it
provides a way to organize material.  For example, a user
can keep the home pages of all of his or her colleagues
together in a deck named "Colleagues," or keep several
Mosaic-style hotlists, each in its own deck.  DeckScape
further uses decks to return the results of certain
operations, such as "expand all the links on this page."

<P> DeckScape is also multi-threaded. In particular,
fetching a new page occurs in the background, in a separate
thread.  Thus, unlike single-threaded browsers, traversing a
slow link or downloading a large file does not freeze the
entire application.  All decks remain active and ready for
browsing, and multiple links can be traversed concurrently.

<P> (Of course, one could start up multiple instances of a
single-threaded browser. This would have the advantage that,
when traversing a slow link or downloading a large file, the
other instances would remain active. However, multiple
instances have the drawback of increasing the amount of
computer resources consumed. Also, multiple instances are
completely independent of each other, so it is not 
possibile to share the information among instances.)


<H2>A Tour of DeckScape</H2>


<H3>Deck Basics</H3>

When DeckScape is first run, the user sees a window
containing a menu bar and a large open area.  This window
forms the <EM>workspace</EM> in which the user positions
decks and pages.

<P> Choosing "New Deck" from the File menu produces a new
deck with a default name, containing a single document: the
user's home page.  Clicking links adds more pages to the
deck.  Buttons let the user shuffle through the deck's
contents or go to the top or bottom of the deck.  The user
can create more decks and use them to follow different
links. This behavior is similar to that of a traditional
browser: creating windows, clicking links and moving forward
and back. 

<P> Here we see DeckScape with a single deck. The deck,
named "WWW'95", has six pages in it. The user is looking at
the second page in the deck, whose URL is
<TT>http://www.igd.fhg.de/www/www95/program.html</TT>:
<BR><CENTER>
<A HREF="SRC-135a-fig1.gif"><IMG SRC="SRC-135a-fig1-thumbnail.gif"></A>
</CENTER>

<P> DeckScape retains all pages until the user explicitly
discards them, while a traditional browser retains only
those pages on the path from the root to the current page.
For example, if a user starts at page A, then traverses some
pages (including B) and ends at C, both DeckScape and a
conventional browser keep copies of all the pages from A to
C.  However, if the user then backs up to B and chooses a
new link, a traditional browser discards all of the pages
after B up to and including C. On the other hand, DeckScape
keeps all of those pages and inserts the new page into the
deck just after B.

<P> This design allows users to quickly switch back and
forth between two or more pages which do not lie on one
convenient path from the root, but rather lie on different
branches of a tree.  Traditional browsers would have to
download and parse each page on each traversal, while
DeckScape allows the user to flip quickly through the deck's
contents without refetching any pages. (DeckScape has a
"Reload" command to refetch a page, rather than use the
page from its internal cache.)

<P> Once a deck has been built up, a user can modify the
contents of a deck in several ways.  Clicking a document's
"D" button deletes the document from its deck.  Dragging a
document from one deck to another moves the document between
decks.  Holding down an appropriate modifier key while
dragging copies the document.  Clicking a deck's "Merge"
button and dragging to another deck merges two decks by
adding all of the pages from the first deck into the second
one, immediately after the second deck's current page.


<H3>"Away" Pages</H3>

DeckScape also offers the ability to temporarily remove a
page from its home deck.  To pull a page away from a deck,
the user drags the page into the workspace background; the
page then appears in a window separate from its home deck.
The page is still a member of the deck, but it is
<EM>away</EM> from the deck rather than <EM>in</EM> it.
Later, the user can issue the deck's "Gather Up" command to
bring the "away" pages back to the deck, or he or she can
drag the pages back to the home deck (or a different deck)
manually.

<P> The ability to pull a page away from its deck allows the
user to simultaneously view two or more pages from the same
deck.  It is often useful to have certain pages, such as
glossaries or reference pages, visible for an extended
period, even while following another chain of links.
DeckScape allows users to drag such pages off to the side
and continue following links on the main body of the deck,
leaving the "special" pages easily accessible.

<P> In the following screen dump, we see three decks, "Ongoing
SRC Research Projects," "Nifty home pages," and "Palo Alto
stuff." The narrow window in the lower-left is showing an
"away" page from the "Palo Alto stuff" deck: 
<BR><CENTER>
<A HREF="SRC-135a-fig2.gif"><IMG SRC="SRC-135a-fig2-thumbnail.gif"></A>
</CENTER>

<P> When the user follows a link on an "away" page, the
resulting new page appears on the main body of the deck.
This behavior is useful when one page, such as a table of
contents, has many links in which the user is interested.
Ordinarily, clicking a link on such a page would cause a new
page to cover up the table of contents, so that the user
must dig through the deck each time he or she wishes to
follow a new link from the table of contents.  However, if
the user were to pull the table of contents away from the
deck, then the page would always be handy for following new
links: the resulting pages appear on the deck and do not
cover up the table of contents.

<P> Similarly, the user could click many links on an "away"
page in rapid succession, causing many new documents to
appear on the deck.  Since DeckScape is multi-threaded, the
user need not wait for one download to complete before
clicking another link.  The user can browse through the
resulting new documents immediately, even before all of the
downloads have completed.  No traditional browser can
support this type of Web exploration because in a
traditional browser clicking a link always makes a new
document cover up the page containing the link.

<P> Browsing in this manner is particularly effective when
combined with a deck's "Make Link Index" command.  This
command finds all of the links on each page in a deck, then
adds to the deck a new page containing all of the links in
alphabetical order.  The new page provides an index of all
the links accessible from any page in the deck.  The user
can then drag the index page away from the deck and click a
series of links, browsing through the resulting documents as
they appear on the main body of the deck.

<P> Another use for "away" pages is for creating new decks.
If a user wants to start a new deck from a particular page,
he or she can drag the page away from its home deck, then
issue the page's "Make New Deck" command.  A new deck
appears, containing the page.


<H3>Organizing Information with Decks</H3>

Decks can be used to organize information found in the Web.
Since decks' contents are automatically saved and restored
when the DeckScape application exits and restarts, users can
use decks to help find pages that they have visited before.
For instance, if a user frequently visits a particular Web
server, he or she can set up a deck to contain pages from
that site, and use the deck to access the site, rather than
follow a series of links from a home page.

<P> Another use of decks is to organize hotlists. DeckScape
has a special hotlist deck, and each document has a "copy to
hotlist" button. When a user comes across an interesting
page, he or she can click the "H" button to copy the page
into the hotlist deck.  Users can also use ordinary decks as
hotlists by manually copying interesting documents into
them; thus, each user can have many hotlists, organized by
whatever criteria are appropriate.  

<P> In the following screen dump, the hotlist deck is in the
lower center. The hotlist is like any other deck, except
that it cannot be renamed or deleted by the user.  The "Goto
Page..." dialog allows the user to select and jump to any
document in a deck, either by its title or by its index.

</CENTER>


<H3>Acquiring Information with Decks</H3>

DeckScape also uses decks to return the results of certain
operations.  For example, issuing a page's "Expand One
Level" command causes DeckScape to traverse each link on the
page and place the resulting documents in a new deck.  The
link traversals all occur in the background, so the user
retains control of the application and can even begin
browsing pages and traversing links in the new deck before
all of the pages have been fetched.  

<P> In the following screen dump, the
deck entitled "Expanding 82 links" is the created by issuing
the "Expand One Level" command in the "Deck 12" deck, while it 
is displaying the home page for the Systems
Research Center. It is common to issue the "Expand One
Level" command on the home page of Web sites in order to
create a new deck that contains the pages most relevant to
the home page. These pages can then be rapidly traversed
with a single button.  When the screen dump was taken, 79 of
the 82 links had been retrieved, and the user was looking at
the 24th page in the deck.
<BR><CENTER>
<A HREF="SRC-135a-fig4.gif"><IMG SRC="SRC-135a-fig4-thumbnail.gif"></A>
</CENTER>

<P> Global search is another operation which returns its
results in a deck.  After the user enters the text to be
found, DeckScape searches through all the pages in each
deck.  It copies the pages that contain hits and makes a new
deck containing the copied pages. 

<P> In the following screen dump, the deck labeled "Search
Results" contains a copy of each page from any deck matching
the string "animation."

<H2>Implementation</H2>

DeckScape is implemented in Modula-3 <A
HREF=#REF-modula3>[2]</A> and consists of about 3500
lines of code. The system makes extensive use of
Modula-3's standard libraries, including the threads
package, user interface toolkit, and persistent data
structures facility.

<P> DeckScape's primary components are object classes
that correspond to portions of the visual interface;
these visual classes have names ending in "VBT". The
VBT classes, along with other non-visual classes,
constitute a hierarchy of abstractions which make it
possible to easily integrate the browser's
functionality into other Modula-3 applications.

<P> The remainder of this section describes the
modules comprising the implementation.

<UL>

<LI>A <TT>WorkspaceVBT</TT> is the main application window;
only one is ever created and it is installed in a top-level
window in the user's desktop.  A <TT>WorkspaceVBT</TT>
provides the global menu bar and the space where the user
positions decks and documents.  The <TT>WorkspaceVBT</TT>
maintains lists of all of the decks and "away" documents.

<P><LI>A <TT>WSObjectVBT</TT> is an abstract class whose
subtypes are objects that can appear in the workspace,
namely decks and "away" documents.  No objects of type
<TT>WSObjectVBT</TT> are ever created; <TT>WSObjectVBT</TT>
exists so that operations that are common to both decks and
"away" documents (such as iconify, raise and lower) can be
defined.

<P><LI>A <TT>DeckVBT</TT> (a subclass of <TT>WSObject</TT>)
is a deck: it contains the deck's title bar, browsing
controls, sizing, iconifying and dragging widgets, and a
menu of miscellaneous commands, as well as space for
displaying a document.

<P><LI>An <TT>AwayVBT</TT> (a subclass of
<TT>WSObject</TT>) represents a document away from its deck:
it contains a title bar for repositioning the "away"
document, sizing, iconifying and dragging widgets, and a
menu of miscellaneous commands, as well as a space for
displaying a document.

<P><LI>A <TT>DocVBT</TT> displays a Web page. It
contains the buttons to delete itself or copy itself
to the hotlist, as well as the draggable banner used
to move the document between decks or "away" from its
home deck. The <TT>DocVBT</TT> also contains space
for the document's contents, displayed by a
<TT>URLVBT</TT>.

<P><LI>A <TT>URLVBT</TT> is an abstract class for
displaying data fetched from a URL. At present, only
two subtypes are defined: one to display plain text
(called a <TT>PlainVBT</TT>) and one to display HTML
(called an <TT>HTMLVBT</TT>).

<P><LI>A <TT>PlainVBT</TT> displays a plain text document.

<P><LI>An <TT>HTMLVBT</TT> displays the contents of
an HTML page.  It allows the user to scroll through
the page and traverse links by clicking.
<TT>HTMLVBT</TT> is still in the very early prototype
stage; it does not support multiple fonts, sizes and
styles, nor does it support inline images and forms.

<P><LI>An <TT>HTML</TT> object is an abstract syntax tree
for an HTML document.  <TT>HTML</TT> objects are produced by
the <TT>Parser</TT> module and used by <TT>HTMLVBT</TT>
objects.

<P><LI>The <TT>Web</TT> module fetches a document from a
given URL.

<P><LI>The <TT>Parser</TT> and <TT>Lexer</TT> modules
produce <TT>HTML</TT> syntax trees from HTML source text
retrieved by <TT>Web</TT>.

</UL>


<H2>Conclusions</H2>

This paper has described DeckScape, an experimental
Web browser. Decks provide a flexible way to organize
Web pages, in many of the same ways that modern
folder-based mail readers (e.g., <TT>xmh</TT> for
Unix) improve on previous generation tty-oriented
mail programs (e.g., <TT>/usr/ucb/mail</TT> for
Unix).  However, DeckScape is lacking essential
Web-browsing features such as inlined images, forms,
multiple fonts, and external viewers. Some of these
deficiencies will be easy to address, but others will
take quite a bit of effort. Because of these
deficiencies, DeckScape is not in daily use, even for
the authors.

<P> We do not claim that DeckScape is <EM>the</EM>
correct way to browse the Web and organize pages in
the Web.  Discovering and quantifying the strengths
and weaknesses of decks are challenges for the
future. We hope that the ideas introduced in this
paper will help to advance the standard for
navigational and organizational capabilities of Web
browsers.
