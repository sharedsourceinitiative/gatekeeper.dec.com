One way of viewing Topaz is as a hybrid of Berkeley's 4.2BSD UNIX
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#joy:4.2sysman">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node19.html#quarterman:berkeleyunix">12</A>] and Xerox's Cedar
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#swinehart:cedar">16</A>].  Topaz borrows the 4.2BSD file system and
large-grain process structure, populates these processes (address spaces)
with Cedar-like threads, and interconnects them with Cedar-like remote
procedure call.  Topaz allows single-threaded programs using the standard
4.2BSD system interface and multithreaded programs using a new Topaz
operating system interface to run on the same machine, to share files, to
send each other signals, and to run each other as processes.
<P>
A Topaz address space has most of the same state components as a UNIX
process has, such as virtual memory, a set of open files, a user id, and
signal-handling information, but is considered as more ``heavyweight''
than a UNIX process.  Like a Cedar programmer, a Topaz programmer can use
threads for fine-grained cooperation within a single address space.
Unlike a Cedar programmer, a Topaz programmer can also use multiple
address spaces to separate programs of different degrees of
trustworthiness.

Multiple threads address a problem different from the one addressed by the
shared memory segments provided by some versions of UNIX, such as System V
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#att:systemvid">2</A>].  While shared segments are useful in allowing
separately developed application programs to have access to a common data
structure, as for example a database buffer pool, multiple threads are
intended to be a ``lightweight'' control structure for use within a single
program.  Modeling threads as separate UNIX processes would place
undesirable restrictions on sharing open files and pointer-containing data
structures among threads.  Creating the dozens or even hundreds of threads
used by some Topaz applications would be slow and extravagant of kernel
resources even if most of the virtual memory resources could be shared.

The semantics of Topaz threads assumes as many processors as threads; the
implementation assigns threads to actual processors.  Threads sharing
variables must therefore explicitly synchronize.  The synchronization
primitives provided (mutexes, conditions, and semaphores) are derived from
Hoare's monitors [<A
 HREF="node19.html#hoare:monitors">6</A>], following the modifications of
Mesa [<A
 HREF="node19.html#lampson:mesaprocess">10</A>]; the details are described by Birrell et
al. [<A
 HREF="node19.html#birrell:synch">4</A>].

Support for multiprocessors in UNIX has evolved over a number of years.
Early multiprocessor implementations of UNIX allowed concurrent execution
of single-threaded processes but didn't support multiple threads.  Many of
these implementations serialized execution within the system kernel; Bach
and Buroff [<A
 HREF="node19.html#bach:multiprocessorunix">3</A>] describe one of the first
implementations to allow concurrency within the kernel.  Several current
systems, such as Apollo's Concurrent Programming Support
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#apollo:cpsreference">1</A>] and Sun's ``lightweight process'' (lwp)
facility [<A
 HREF="node19.html#kepecs:sunlwp">8</A>], support multiple threads within a UNIX
process, but can't assign more than one thread within an address space to
a processor at any one time.  Like the Firefly implementation of Topaz,
C-MU's Mach [<A
 HREF="node19.html#rashid:threads">13</A>] supports concurrent execution of threads
within an address space on a multiprocessor.  The approach taken by
Apollo, Sun, and Mach in adding threads to UNIX is to minimize the impact
on the rest of the system interface, to make it easier to add the use of
multiple threads to large existing programs.  In contrast, the approach
taken in Topaz is to integrate the use of threads with all the other
programming facilities.
