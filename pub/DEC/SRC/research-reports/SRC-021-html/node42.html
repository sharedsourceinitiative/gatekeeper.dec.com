<P>
This subsection describes the procedures for reading, writing, and
copying files, as well as some miscellaneous procedures for scheduling
input/output.
<P>
The Taos implementation of these procedures uses enough threads to achieve
the maximum throughput; there is no need for the client to use concurrent
calls for greater throughput.

PROCEDURE Read(
    f: File;

Let sub be the subarray buf[start FOR length].  For some nonnegative
integer n, Read transfers bytes from the specified file to the subarray
sub[0 FOR n] and returns the value n.  It raises OperationConflictEC if
the open-file object referred to by f was not opened with the fRead flag.
<P><A NAME="961">&#160;</A>
When Read is used on a regular file, the transfer starts at the file
position indicated by the file pointer in the open-file object, and
continues until the end of sub or the end of the file is reached,
whichever comes first;  the file pointer is advanced by the amount read.
Thus a return value less then the length of sub indicates the end of the
file was reached.
<P><A NAME="962">&#160;</A>
When Read is used on a pipe or unstructured device, the transfer starts at
the current position.  If one or more characters are available, the
transfer begins immediately; it continues until the end of sub or the end
of the available characters is reached, whichever comes first.  If no
characters are currently available, but end of file has not been reached,
Read blocks until one or more characters become available; this is the
only time Read is alertable.  Thus a return value of zero indicates the
end of the file was reached.  (The read-end of a pipe is at end of file
when there are no longer outstanding file handles for the write-end and
all the buffered data has been exhausted.)

If Read is used on the control terminal and the calling process is not in
the distinguished process group of that device, Read sends a SigTTIn
signal to the process group of the caller and blocks the calling thread
(assuming the calling process is not an orphan and is not ignoring
SigTTIn; otherwise Read raises NotTtyOwnerReadEC).  See Section

Let sub be the subarray buf[start FOR length].  For some nonnegative
integer n, FRead transfers bytes from the specified file to the subarray
sub[0 FOR n] and returns the value n.  It raises UnseekableObjectEC if
applied to anything other than a regular file, or OperationConflictEC if
the open-file object referred to by f was not opened with the fRead flag.
<P><A NAME="972">&#160;</A>
The transfer starts at the specified position, and continues until the end
of sub or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes first.  A return
value less than the length of sub indicates the end of the file was
reached.  FRead does not examine or modify the file pointer in the
open-file object.
<P>
Ultrix note: FRead will fail in non-obvious ways when used on a file whose
open-file object is shared with another process.  For more details, see

Let sub be the subarray buf[start FOR length].  Write transfers all of sub
to the specified file.  It raises OperationConflictEC if the open-file
object referred to by f was not opened with the fWrite flag.
<P><A NAME="2063">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="979">&#160;</A>
When Write is used on a regular file, the transfer normally starts at the
position indicated by the file pointer in the open-file object.  However,
if the fAppend flag is set in the open-file object, the transfer starts at
the current end of file.  Write always sets the file pointer to the
position after the last byte transferred.  It automatically extends the
length of a regular file with bytes containing zero if the starting
position is past the end of the file.
<P><A NAME="980">&#160;</A>
When Write is used on a pipe or unstructured device, the transfer starts
at the current position.  If the pipe or device is currently incapable of
accepting the full amount requested, Write repeatedly writes as much as
possible and blocks until more buffer space is available; this is the only
time Write is Alertable.
<P><A NAME="981">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="982">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="983">&#160;</A>
If Write is used on a pipe whose reading end is closed, an error occurs.
This error is reported in one of two ways, depending on the setting of the
SigPipe signal state (see the SetMySignalState procedure, page
<A HREF="node50.html#Saratoga"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  If the setting is SignalIgnore, Write raises
PipeHasNoReaderEC; otherwise the call to Write never returns, and the
process is sent a SigPipe signal, which by default causes the process to
terminate.  (Rather than trying to handle SigPipe, a process should be
programmed to catch PipeHasNoReaderEC.)

The transfer starts at the specified position in the file, except that if

Copy and FCopy copy a range of bytes from a source file to a destination
file and return the number of bytes actually transferred.  They raise
InvalidArgumentEC if the source and destination refer to the same
open-file object; they raise OperationConflictEC if the source was not
opened with the fRead flag or the destination was not opened with the
fWrite flag.
<P><A NAME="2072">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1002">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1003">&#160;</A>
Copy can be used with any combination of files (regular, device, pipe,
etc.).  When the source is a regular file, Copy starts the transfer at the
position indicated by the file pointer in the open-file object, and
advances that file pointer by the amount transferred.  When the
destination is a regular file, Copy normally starts the transfer at the
position indicated by the file pointer in the open-file object.  However,
if the fAppend flag is set in the open-file object, the transfer starts at
the current end of file.  Copy always advances the file pointer in a
destination regular file by the amount transferred.  It automatically
extends the length of a destination regular file with bytes containing
zero if the starting position is past the end of the file.
<P>
When the source or destination is a pipe or unstructured device, the
transfer starts at the current position and is alertable if Copy is
blocked waiting either for bytes from the source or for space in the
destination.  In any case, the transfer continues for the specified length
or until the end of the source file is reached, whichever comes first.
<P><A NAME="2073">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1005">&#160;</A>
FCopy raises UnseekableObjectEC unless the source and destination are
regular files.  The transfer starts at the specified positions in the
source and destination, except that if destinationPosition equals
LAST(CARDINAL), the transfer begins at the end of the destination file.
FCopy ignores the fAppend flag and the the file pointer in the destination
open-file object. FCopy automatically extends the length of the
destination file with bytes containing zero if the starting position is
past the end of the file.

PROCEDURE EnsureWritten(f: File) RAISES {Error};

EnsureWritten makes sure that all changes to the data and attributes of
the file performed before EnsureWritten was called are flushed to the
disk.  EnsureWritten doesn't return until the flushing is complete.
<P>
To avoid the need for most programs to call EnsureWritten, the system
contains a daemon that regularly flushes all changes to file data and
attributes.
<P><A NAME="1008">&#160;</A>
Taos note: The file flushing daemon runs every 60 seconds; it does not
flush changes to file access times.
<P>
Ultrix note: For a file residing on an Ultrix system, it is not possible
to guarantee that the changes will be reflected to disk before
EnsureWritten returns.  The file flushing daemon runs every 30 seconds.

PROCEDURE CharsAvail(

</PRE>
<P><A NAME="1012">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1013">&#160;</A>
CharsAvail returns the number of characters available for transferring in
the specified direction.  If the file is a pipe or a socket, this is the
number of available characters in the buffer that can be read or written.
If the file is a device, the underlying device is queried to determine the
most characters it can handle without blocking in the specified direction.
If the file is a regular file, the direction is Input, and the file
pointer in the open-file object is positioned before the end of file, the
result is the difference between the end-of-file position and the file
pointer.  Otherwise the result is LAST(CARDINAL).
<P>
If band is not equal to InBand, zero is returned.  (OutOfBand is for
future implementation of sockets.)
<P>
OperationConflictEC is raised if direction equals Input and the file is
not open for reading or if direction equal Output and the file is not open
for writing.
<P><A NAME="2078">&#160;</A>

PROCEDURE Wait(
    f: File;
    direction: Direction := Input;
    band: Band := InBand)
  RAISES {Error, Alerted};
  (* BadFileEC, OperationConflictEC,
     IOErrorEC, PvOfflineEC, RemoteFileEC *)
</PRE>
<P>
Wait blocks until a call to CharsAvail with the same parameters would
return a nonzero value.  Wait raises OperationConflictEC under the same
conditions as does CharsAvail.  If band equals OutOfBand, CharsAvail would
return 0, so Wait blocks forever.  Note that if f refers to a regular
file, Wait always returns immediately.  Wait is alertable.
