File System</A>
</H2>
<P><A NAME="262">&#160;</A>
A UNIX process contains several components of mutable file system state
that would cause problems for multithreaded programs, including the
working directory, the table of file descriptor references, and the stream
position pointer inside each file descriptor.  The Topaz design has made
adjustments for each of these.
<P><A NAME="263">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="264">&#160;</A>
A UNIX path name is looked up relative to the file system root if it
begins with ``/''; otherwise it is looked up relative to the working
directory.  Each process has its own working directory, which is initially
equal to the parent's and may be changed using the <TT>chdir</TT> system call.
Since looking up a short relative path name can be significantly faster
than looking up the corresponding full path name, some UNIX programs use
the working directory as a sort of ``cursor'', for example when
enumerating a subtree of the file system.  To facilitate multithreaded
versions of such programs (and modular programming in general), Topaz
parameterizes the notion of working directory.  The <TT>OpenDir</TT> procedure
accepts the path name of a directory, and returns a handle for that
directory.  Every procedure that accepts a path name argument also accepts
a directory handle argument that is used when the path name doesn't begin
with ``/''.  The distinguished directory handle <TT>NIL</TT> can be used to
refer to the initial working directory supplied when the process was
created.
<P><A NAME="268">&#160;</A>
Part of the state maintained by UNIX for each process is a table with an
entry for each open file held by the process.  An application program uses
small nonnegative integer indexes in this table to refer to open files.
In a multithreaded application it is desirable to avoid the need to
serialize sequences of operations affecting the allocation of table
entries (e.g., <TT>open</TT>, <TT>dup</TT>, and <TT>close</TT>).  To achieve this
goal, the table indexes should be treated as opaque quantities: it should
not be assumed that there is a deterministic relationship between
successive values returned by operations such as <TT>open</TT>.
(Single-threaded UNIX programs actually depend on being able to control
the allocation of table indices when preparing to start another program
image.  Topaz avoids this dependency, as described in Section
<A HREF="node15.html#sec-processcreation">4.4</A>.)
<P><A NAME="274">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="275">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="276">&#160;</A>
Recall from the example in Section <A HREF="node8.html#sec-sharing">3.1</A> that the stream
position pointer in a UNIX file descriptor causes interference when
threads share the descriptor.  Topaz still implements these pointers so
that Topaz and UNIX programs can share open files, but to allow multiple
threads to share a file descriptor without having to serialize, Topaz
provides additional procedures <TT>FRead</TT> and <TT>FWrite</TT> that accept a
file position as an extra argument.
<P><A NAME="280">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="281">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="282">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="283">&#160;</A>
The 4.2BSD UNIX file system interface contains a number of ad hoc
multiplexing mechanisms that are described in Section <A HREF="node9.html#sec-adhoc">3.2</A>.
These mechanisms allow a single-threaded UNIX process to overlap
computation and input/output transfers that involve devices such as
terminals and network connections.  Topaz simply eliminates these
mechanisms (non-blocking mode, the <TT>select</TT> procedure, and asynchronous
mode) and substitutes <TT>Read</TT> and <TT>Write</TT> procedures that block until
the transfer is complete.  <TT>Read</TT> and <TT>Write</TT> are alertable when a
transfer is not yet possible.  Note that Topaz violates guideline 2 of
Section <A HREF="node10.html#sec-cancelling">3.3</A> by not providing nonalertable variants of
<TT>Read</TT> and <TT>Write</TT>.  (For completeness, Topaz provides a <TT>Wait</TT>
procedure that waits until a specified open file is ready for a transfer.)
