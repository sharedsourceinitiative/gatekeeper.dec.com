Processes</A>

A Topaz process is a set of threads of control executing within a single
virtual address space; a process also has a number of state variables
maintained by the operating system such as identification, access control,
and open files.  A Topaz application is made up of a single process or a
set of communicating processes; every program (except parts of the
operating system itself) executes within the context of some process.
<P><A NAME="473">&#160;</A>
The Topaz definition of a process is very similar to the Ultrix
definition, with the main exception that a Topaz process can contain
multiple threads of control.
<P><A NAME="474">&#160;</A>
What can a process do?  It can execute object programs within its own
address space, it can make remote procedure calls to other processes (on
either the same or a different machine), and it can invoke the operating
system by calling procedures in Topaz interfaces such as Thread and OS.
Through OS, it can manipulate files and create and control other
processes.  Finally, it can request that its own execution be terminated.
<P><A NAME="475">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="476">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="477">&#160;</A>
Every process has a process identifier.  Its value is an integer between
one and about 32000 (for compatibility with Ultrix).  The process
identifier remains constant over the life of the process and serves as the
name used by a client of OS to manipulate that process.  At no time do any
two processes on the same machine have the same process identifier, but
process identifiers are reused over time.  The process identifier equal to
one always belongs to the Init process.

<A NAME="480">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="481">&#160;</A>
Every process belongs to one process group, identified by a process group
identifier. The process group identifier is generally equal to the process
identifier of the process that is the `leader' of the group, and is
specified when the process is created.  Process groups form a larger level
of granularity to which signals can be sent, and are also used as owners
of tty devices.  Process groups are discussed more thoroughly in Section

The processes running on a machine are ordered into a tree by the parent
relation.  The transitive closure of the parent relation is the ancestor
relation.  The inverse of the parent relation is the child relation and
the inverse of the ancestor relation is the descendant relation.  The root
of the tree is the Init process; it is the ancestor of all other
processes.

<A NAME="492">&#160;</A>

Normally a process becomes the parent of a process it creates.  A parent
process is expected to look after its children.  In particular, it should
call WaitForChild for each of its children (see page <A HREF="node52.html#Newark"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).
Also, a parent is allowed to set the process group of, or send a SigCont
signal to, any of its descendants.  When a process terminates, any
children it may still have become orphans and are automatically adopted by
the Init process.  It is also possible to create a process as an orphan
(see the StartProcess procedure, page <A HREF="node51.html#MountainView"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).
<P><A NAME="498">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="499">&#160;</A>
To avoid interference between multiple threads running within a process,
many components of the process state should not be changed after the
process is started.  Instead, a process template mechanism is provided for
setting these state components at the time the process is created (see
section <A HREF="node51.html#Albany">5.3</A>, page <A HREF="node51.html#Albany"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  Also, many procedures in OS
accept parameters that might be implicit process state components in a
single-threaded system such as Ultrix.  (Appendix <A HREF="node55.html#LaHonda">A.1</A>, page
<A HREF="node55.html#LaHonda"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, describes procedures in the OSFriends interface that
modify global process state components; use them at your own risk.)
