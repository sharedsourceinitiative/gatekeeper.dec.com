The OS Interface: EC</A>
</H2>
<P><A NAME="2264">&#160;</A>
This section explains the meaning of each value ec in the set EC.  The
format of each paragraph is:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ec: OS.errMessage[ec]</B> Brief description of ec.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Recall that a value of type EC accompanies the exception Error.  Error and
EC are defined in Section <A HREF="node36.html#Soquel">3.2</A>, page <A HREF="node36.html#Soquel"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>BadExecutableEC: StartProcess format error</STRONG>

<DD>The new path name
    supplied to HardLink was a directory.
<P><DT><STRONG>CannotWriteADirectoryEC: Write to a directory</STRONG>
<DD>The path name to be opened
    for writing was that of a directory.
<P><DT><STRONG>CrossDeviceLinkEC: Cross-device link</STRONG>

    file on another logical volume.

<DD>An attempt was made to delete a
    directory that was not empty.
<P><DT><STRONG>DirectoryUnlinkEC: Remove or Rename of a directory</STRONG>
<DD>The path name of a
    directory was supplied where that of a file was required (Remove,
    Rename).
<P><DT><STRONG>FileBusyEC: File or directory in use</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to open a file
    whose exclusive-use flag had been set, or to delete a directory that

<DD>A name proposed for a new directory entry was
    already in use.
<P><DT><STRONG>IOErrorEC: I/O error</STRONG>
<DD>A problem occurred reading or writing
    the storage medium underlying a file or directory.  This may result
    in the volume being marked as needing scavenging.  The system should
    log the specific problem, but isn't currently.
<P><DT><STRONG>InvalidArgumentEC: Invalid argument</STRONG>
<DD>The argument for an operation was
    invalid, e.g., Seek to a negative position, or use of an invalid
    process template.
<P><DT><STRONG>InvalidCredentialsEC: Invalid credentials</STRONG>
<DD>The supplied real user name
    and password did not agree with the authentication database.
<P><DT><STRONG>InvalidObjectEC: Operation/file mismatch</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to do an
    operation on a type of file that doesn't support it, for example a
    GetLock, SetLock, or SetExclusiveUse on a pipe or socket.  It is also
    raised when an operation such as Read or Write (or Close) is applied
    to a TEm window that has been destroyed.
<P><DT><STRONG>LookUpEC: No such file or directory</STRONG>
<DD>A component of the path name was not
    found in the indicated directory.
<P><DT><STRONG>MinorDeviceDoesNotExistEC: No such minor device number</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was
    made to open a device, but the minor device number was not known by
    the driver determined by the major device number.
<P><DT><STRONG>NameTooLongEC: Name too long</STRONG>
<DD>A component of a path name was longer than
    255 characters, or, on Ultrix, an entire path name exceeded 1023
    characters.
<P><DT><STRONG>NoDriverForDeviceEC: No such major device number</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to
    open a device, but no device driver had been registered for the
    corresponding major device number.
<P><DT><STRONG>NoMountedVolumesEC: No mounted volumes</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to look up a
    path name before any logical volume had been mounted.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotADirectoryEC: Not a directory</STRONG>
<DD>A component of a path name was not a
    directory.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotATerminalEC: Not a terminal</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to specify as a
    control terminal a file other than a terminal device.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotEnoughRoomEC: Not enough disk space</STRONG>
<DD>There was insufficient space to
    create or extend a file.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotEnoughVMEC: Not enough VM</STRONG>
<DD>Starting a process would have required more
    virtual memory than allowed by the imposed maximum.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotImplementedEC: Unimplemented operation</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to perform
    an operation that is not yet implemented but that should be.  Consult
    the wrelease notes for details of a particular version.

<DD>An attempt was made to perform an operation only
    permissible by the owner of a file or a process.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotSuperUserEC: Not super-user</STRONG>

    operation only permissible by the super-user, e.g., supplying an
    explicit User specification to an operation such as Open.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotTtyOwnerReadEC: Background write</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to read or copy
    from a device without being in its distinguished process group.
<P><DT><STRONG>NotTtyOwnerWriteEC: Background read</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to write or copy
    to a device without being in its distinguished process group.
<P><DT><STRONG>OkEC: No error</STRONG>
<DD>No error (never raised).
<P><DT><STRONG>OperationConflictEC: Operation/open mode mismatch</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to
    do an operation that is not compatible with the way the file was
    opened, e.g., a Write using a file handle opened for reading.
<P><DT><STRONG>PipeHasNoReaderEC: Broken pipe</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to write to a pipe
    whose reading end is no longer open.
<P><DT><STRONG>ProtectionViolationEC: Permission denied</STRONG>
<DD>An attempt was made to modify a
    read-only server set or perform an operation on a file or directory
    whose current access mode disallowed it.
<P><DT><STRONG>PvOfflineEC: Physical volume not online</STRONG>
<DD>A physical disk volume
    required to perform the operation was offline.  The volume needed
    should be logged, but isn't currently.
<P><DT><STRONG>RanOutOfResourcesEC: Ultrix server ran out of file descriptors</STRONG>
<DD>An
    open of a file residing on an Ultrix machine failed because of a lack
    of file descriptors.
<P><DT><STRONG>RemoteFileEC: Remote file server call failed</STRONG>
<DD>An RPC call to a remote

<DD>A server needed to look up a
    remote path name was not available.

<DD>The a.out file
    supplied to StartProcess or StartProcessSearch was shorter than
    its header implied.
<P><DT><STRONG>TooManyProcessesEC: Too many processes</STRONG>

    (on Taos) or process table entries (on Ultrix) when
    StartProcess or StartProcessSearch was called.
<P><DT><STRONG>TooManySymbolicLinksInPathEC: Too many levels of symbolic
    links</STRONG>
<DD>A possible loop in symbolic links was encountered (more
    than 5 remote symbolic links or 16 symbolic links per remote
    file machine).
<P><DT><STRONG>UnseekableObjectEC: Illegal seek</STRONG>
<DD>Seek was called with a pipe.
<P><DT><STRONG>VolumeNeedsCheckingEC: Volume needs scavenging</STRONG>
<DD>An
    inconsistency was found on a disk volume requiring that it be
    scavenged.

    noBlock equal to TRUE, and there was a conflict over the lock.
    (Read and Write never raise WouldBlockEC.)
