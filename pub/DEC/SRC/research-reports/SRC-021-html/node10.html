Cancelling Operations</A>
</H2>
<A NAME="sec-cancelling">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="205">&#160;</A>
Many application programs allow the cancellation of a command in progress.
For example, the user may decide not to wait for the completion of a
computation or the availability of a resource.  In order to allow prompt
cancellation, an application needs a way of notifying all the relevant
threads of the change in plans.
<P>
If the entire application is designed as one large module, then state
variables, monitors, and condition variables may be enough to implement
cancellation requests.  However if the application is composed of
lower-level modules defined by interfaces, it is much more convenient to
be able to notify a thread of a cancellation request without regard for
what code the thread is currently executing.

The Modula-2+ language [<A
 HREF="node19.html#rovner:extendingmodula2">15</A>] in which Topaz
programs are written provides the <I>alert</I> mechanism [<A
 HREF="node19.html#birrell:synch">4</A>]
for this purpose (Mesa provides a similar <I>abort</I> mechanism
[<A
 HREF="node19.html#lampson:mesaprocess">10</A>]).  Sending an alert to a thread simply puts it
in the alerted state.  A thread can atomically test-and-clear its alerted
status by calling a procedure <TT>TestAlert</TT>.  Of course this is a form of
polling, and isn't always appropriate or efficient.  To avoid the need to
poll, there exist variants of the procedures for waiting on condition
variables and semaphores.  These variants, <TT>AlertWait</TT> and <TT>AlertP</TT>,
return prematurely with a special indication if the calling thread is
already in, or enters, the alerted state.  The variants also clear the
alerted status.  We refer to the procedures <TT>TestAlert</TT>,
<TT>AlertWait</TT>, and
<TT>AlertP</TT>, and to procedures that call them, as <I>alertable</I>.
<P><A NAME="227">&#160;</A>
What then is the effect of alerts on interface design?  Deciding which
procedures in an interface should be alertable requires making a trade-off
between the ease of writing responsive programs and the ease of writing
correct programs.  Each call of an alertable procedure provides another
point at which a computation can be cancelled, but each such call also
requires the caller to design code to handle the two possible outcomes:
normal completion and an alert being reported.  We have formulated the
following guidelines for using alerts, which in some sense lead to the
minimum set of alertable procedures necessary to allow top-level programs
to cancel operations:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Only the owner of a thread, that is the program that forked it,
should alert the thread.  This is because an alert carries no parameters
    or information about its sender.  A corollary is that a procedure that
    clears the alerted status of a thread must report that fact to its caller,
    so that the information can propagate back to the owner.
<P><DT>2.
<DD><A NAME="229">&#160;</A>
    Suppose there is an interface M providing a procedure P that does an
    unbounded wait, that is a wait whose duration cannot be bounded by
    appeal to M's specification alone.  Then M should provide alertable
    and nonalertable variants of the procedure, just as Modula-2+ does for
    waits on condition variables and semaphores.  (The interface might
    provide either separate procedures or one procedure accepting an
    ``alertable'' Boolean parameter.)  A client procedure Q should use the
    alertable variant of P when it needs to be alertable itself and cannot
    determine a bound on P's wait.
<P><DT>3.
<DD>A procedure that performs a lengthy computation should follow one of
    two strategies.  It can allow partial operations, so that its client can
    decompose a long operation into a series of shorter ones separated by an
    alert test.  Or it can accept an ``alertable'' Boolean parameter that
    governs whether the procedure periodically tests for alerts.
<P></DL>
<P>
If all interfaces follow these rules, a main program can always alert its
worker threads with the assurance that they will eventually report back.
The implementation of an interface might choose to call alertable
procedures in more cases than required by the second guideline, gaining
quicker response to alerts at the cost of more effort to maintain its
invariants.
