The Topaz system attempts to protect against threats to privacy and denial
of service due to human error and, to a lesser extent, human malfeasance.
The security model is based on an open, distributed environment of
communicating workstations and servers.  The implication is that a user
can do pretty much anything to his own workstation, but must provide
authentication for access to remote resources.  There are many gaps in the
current implementation (e.g., both data and passwords are transmitted
unencrypted on the network), but we believe the basic structure can be
elaborated to provide an adequate combination of flexibility and security.
<P><A NAME="531">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="532">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="533">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="534">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="535">&#160;</A>
The Topaz operating system implements security by validating that each
attempt by a process to perform an operation affecting shared system state
is allowed by a set of access control information.  The validation rules
are based on the notion of a principal, which is supposed to represent a
person or agency.  The operating system associates with every file and
directory an owning principal, and with every process a sponsoring
principal.  The operating system identifies a principal with his/her/its
user name: a string of one or more ASCII characters.
<P><A NAME="536">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="537">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="538">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="539">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="540">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1974">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="542">&#160;</A>
Three credentials are part of the state of every process: a real user
name, a password, and an effective user name.  The real user name and
password specify and authenticate the principal on whose behalf the
process is executing; they are used for validating all access to remote
files.  The effective user name is used for validating all access to local
files and for all other local operations.  If the effective user name is
root, all local file accesses and operations are permitted; such a process
is referred to as the super-user. Normally the effective user name is
equal to the real user name.  However, if a program object file has its
SetUIDonExec flag set, then executing it as a process causes that process
to have as its effective user name the owner of the file.
<P><A NAME="1975">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1964">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="1965">&#160;</A>
A process normally inherits the credentials of the process that starts it,
although this may be changed using SetUser for a new process or
OSFriends.SetMyUser for an existing process.  In any case a valid password
is checked for whenever a real user name is supplied.  (There is one
exception: a process with effective and real user names equal to root and
an empty password string is allowed the same remote access as the user
named ff<TT>&#95;</TT>ftp.  The user named ff<TT>&#95;</TT>ftp is given minimal access according to
the rules on page <A HREF="node40.html#Orinda"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>; its password is never checked.)
<P><A NAME="549">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="550">&#160;</A>
A system must provide flexibility in describing access control
relationships, or else users tend to disable the security checking.  To
increase flexibility, the Topaz operating system allows the definition of
arbitrary user groups (subsets of the community of users), and allows the
owner of each file to single out one user group to receive specific access
rights.  The owner of a file may also specify access rights to be enjoyed
by all others (those not the owner and not in the group).

<A NAME="552">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="553">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="554">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="555">&#160;</A>
The truth for password validation and user group membership ultimately
resides in the master files /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  (At SRC, the
truth lives in the copies of those files residing on the machine named
palo-alto.)  A daemon copies this information to the Interim Name Service
every night.  The system uses the Interim Name Service if it is available;
otherwise it uses a local copy of /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  Someday,
the truth will move to the [Interim] Name Service.  (See ns(8).)
<P><A NAME="556">&#160;</A>
Although a process with effective user name equal to root has super-user
privileges for all local operations, such a process does not automatically
have super-user privileges when accessing remote files.  Only a process
with real user name equal to root and having the matching `global root'
password can exercise remote super-user privileges.

<A NAME="1976">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="560">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="561">&#160;</A>
All procedures that do access checking accept an optional user
specification to use for local access checking, which may be specified
only by the super-user. This is to allow a server process to access local
files on behalf of more than one client.  (User specifications are created
by OSFriends.LookUpUser; see page <A HREF="node56.html#Pacifica"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
