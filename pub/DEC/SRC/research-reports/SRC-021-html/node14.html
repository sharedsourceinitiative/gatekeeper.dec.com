A UNIX signal is used to communicate an event to a process or to exercise
supervisory control over a process (termination or temporary suspension).
A UNIX signal communicates either a synchronous event (a trap, stemming
directly from an action of the receiving process) or an asynchronous one
(an interrupt, stemming from another process, user, or device).
<P>
UNIX models signal delivery on hardware interrupts.  A process registers a
handler procedure for each signal it wants to handle.  When a signal is
received, the current computation is interrupted by the creation of an
activation record for the handler procedure on the top of the stack of the
process.  This handler procedure may either return normally, resulting in
the interrupted computation continuing, or may do a ``long jump'',
unwinding the stack to a point specified earlier in the computation.  If a
signal is received for which no handler procedure was registered, a
default action takes place.  Depending on the signal, the default action
is either to do nothing, to terminate the process, to stop the process
temporarily, or to continue the stopped process.  Following the hardware
interrupt model, 4.2BSD UNIX allows each signal to be ignored or
temporarily masked.
<P><A NAME="298">&#160;</A>
Topaz signals are patterned after UNIX signals, and in fact Topaz and UNIX
programs running on the same machine can send each other signals.
However, UNIX signal delivery is another ad hoc way of multiplexing the
single program counter of a process.  Trying to use interrupt-style signal
delivery in a multithreaded environment leads to problems.  Which thread
should receive the signal?  What does a signal handler procedure do if it
needs to acquire a lock held by the thread it has interrupted?  Rather
than answering these questions, we avoided them.

<A NAME="301">&#160;</A>
A Topaz process can specify that it wants to handle a particular signal,
but it doesn't register a handler procedure.  Instead, it arranges for one
of its threads to call <TT>WaitForSignal</TT>.  This procedure blocks until a
signal arrives, then returns its signal number.  The calling thread then
takes whatever action is appropriate, for example initiating graceful
shutdown.   <TT>WaitForSignal</TT> takes a parameter that specifies a subset
of the handled signals, so a program may have more than one
signal-handling thread.  The set of signals that it makes sense to handle
is smaller in Topaz than in UNIX, since those used as part of various UNIX
ad hoc multiplexing schemes (e.g., <TT>SIGALRM</TT>, <TT>SIGURG</TT>, <TT>SIGIO</TT>,
and <TT>SIGCHLD</TT>) are never sent to multithreaded processes.  Topaz
provides the same default actions as UNIX for signals not handled by the
process.  The decision about which signals to handle and which to default
is necessarily global to the entire process; any dynamic changes must be
synchronized by the client.
<P><A NAME="308">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="309">&#160;</A>
UNIX system calls that do unbounded waits (e.g., reading from a terminal
or waiting for a child process to terminate) are interruptible by signals.
But this interruptibility leads to difficulties that are avoidable in the
multithreaded case.  A client program will normally want to restart a
system call interrupted by a signal that indicates completion of some
asynchronous operation, but will probably not want to restart a system
call interrupted by a signal that indicates a request for cancellation of
a computation.  Different versions of UNIX have tried different approaches
to the restartability of system calls.  In Topaz, there is no need for
signal delivery itself to interrupt any system call.  The signal handling
thread may decide to alert one or more other threads, which raises an
<TT>Alerted</TT> exception in any thread doing an unbounded wait in a system call.
<P><A NAME="311">&#160;</A>
Instead of using signals to report synchronous events, Topaz uses
Modula-2+ exceptions.  For example, the <TT>AddressFault</TT> exception is
raised when a thread dereferences an invalid address.  Since the contexts
statically and dynamically surrounding where an exception is raised
determine what handler is invoked for that exception, different threads
can have different responses.
<P><A NAME="313">&#160;</A>
Modula-2+ exceptions are based on a termination model: scopes between the
points where an exception is raised and where it is handled are
<I>finalized</I> (given a chance to clean up and then removed from the stack)
before the handler is given control.  While this model has proven its
worth in constructing large modular systems, it does lead to a
complication involving traps.  An exception is an appropriate way to
report a trap considered to be an error, but isn't appropriate for a trap
such as breakpoint or page fault whose handler wishes to resume.  Topaz
therefore provides a lower-level trap mechanism that suspends a thread at
the point of the trap and then wakes up a trap-handling thread.  The
trap-handling thread either converts the trap to an exception in the
trapping thread, or handles it and restarts the thread, as appropriate.
