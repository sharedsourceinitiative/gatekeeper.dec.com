Address Spaces</A>
</H2>
<P><A NAME="505">&#160;</A>
An address space is a partial mapping from addresses to updatable storage
locations.  Every process has an address space; it holds the program
object code, global variables, local variables, and dynamically allocated
(heap) variables.
<P><A NAME="506">&#160;</A>
Programmers using languages such as Modula-2+ and Tinylisp are mostly
concerned with higher-level abstractions of storage allocation (e.g.,
NEW).  However, knowledge of some of the lower-level details may make it
easier to design and debug reliable, efficient programs.
<P><A NAME="507">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="508">&#160;</A>
The domain of an address space is a set of 32-bit quantities called
addresses and the range is a set of 8-bit storage locations.  The mapping
from addresses to storage locations is partial: an address is said to be
unmapped if it is not in the domain.  If address i is unmapped in an
address space, then so are the addresses j, j+1, ..., j+P-1, where j = (i
DIV P) * P.  The constant P is called the page size, and is always a power
of two not less than 512.  (The exact value for P is a system tuning
parameter.)  Addresses j, j+1, ..., j+P-1, where j is an integral multiple
of P, are said to belong to the same page.
<P><A NAME="509">&#160;</A>
Not all storage locations in an address space may actually be updatable by
the program running in that address space.  Individual pages within the
address space can be specified as unwritable.
<P><A NAME="510">&#160;</A>
If a program makes a reference to an address that is unmapped or
unwritable, a hardware trap occurs that normally leads to the termination
of the process.  The Modula-2+ typechecking rules are intended to make it
impossible for a SAFE module to pass such an improper address as a VAR or
VAR IN parameter to a procedure in the OS interface.  However, if an OS
procedure is supplied an unmapped address or an unwritable address for a
result parameter, it simulates the appropriate hardware trap in its
caller.
<P><A NAME="511">&#160;</A>
When a Modula-2+ program runs on Taos, the first page of its address space
(i.e., the one containing addresses 0 through P-1) is unmapped, to help
detect attempts to dereference NIL REFs and pointers.  Following this page
comes the program's object code, followed by its global variables,
followed by dynamically allocated storage.  Starting at a point near the
middle of the 32-bit address range and growing towards smaller addresses
are the stacks of the threads living in the address space.  Each stack has
the same maximum length, and on Taos is terminated with an unmapped page
to help detect stack overflow. Between the last of the
dynamically allocated storage and the stacks is a sequence of unmapped
pages.
<P><A NAME="512">&#160;</A>
The top half of the 32-bit address range is reserved for operating system
code; most of it appears unmapped to a user process.  However, on Taos
there are a set of RPC buffers in this range that are mapped as writable
pages in every address space.  If a buggy program stores into these
buffers, bad things can happen to all processes running on the machine.

For more information on addressing and virtual memory management, consult
the VAX Architecture Handbook and the VM interface.
