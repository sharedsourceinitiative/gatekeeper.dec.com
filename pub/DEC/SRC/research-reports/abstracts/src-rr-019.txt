Author's Abstract
 
    The standard explanations of the theory underlying the Bezier
    and B-spline curves and surfaces used in computer-aided geometric
    design are not as simple as they should be, because there is no
    easy way to tell, from the labels in the diagrams, what geometric
    relationships hold among the labeled points.  This paper proposes
    a new labeling scheme, based on the work of P.~de~Casteljau.  The
    key idea is a classical mathematical principle, which we christen
    the Blossoming Principle:  a univariate polynomial of degree  n
    is equivalent to a symmetric polynomial in  n  variables that
    is linear in each variable separately.  Blossoming a Bezier curve
    or surface provides lucid labels both for its Bezier points and
    for all of the intermediate points that arise in the de Casteljau
    Algorithm.  Blossoming a spline curve with parametric continuity
    provides lucid labels for its de Boor points and for the points
    that arise in the de Boor Algorithm.  Spline curves with geometric
    continuity and spline surfaces with triangular patches present
    unsolved labeling challenges, however.
