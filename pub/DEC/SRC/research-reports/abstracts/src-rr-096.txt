"How to Make a Correct Multiprocess Program Execute Correctly on a Multiprocessor"
Leslie Lamport
February 14, 1993.  8 pages.

A multiprocess program executing on a modern multiprocessor must issue
explicit commands to synchronize memory accesses.  A method is proposed
for deriving the necessary commands from a correctness proof of the
algorithm.
