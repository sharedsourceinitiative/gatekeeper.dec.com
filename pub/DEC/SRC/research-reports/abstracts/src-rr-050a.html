    Modeling two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects is an
    important theme in computer graphics.  Two main types of models
    are used in both cases: boundary representations, which represent
    the surface of an object explicitly but represent its interior only
    implicitly, and constructive solid geometry representations, which
    model a complex object, surface and interior together, as a boolean
    combination of simpler objects.  Because neither representation
    is good for all applications, conversion between the two is often
    necessary.
<P>
    We consider the problem of converting boundary representations of
    polyhedral objects into constructive solid geometry (CSG)
    representations.  The CSG representations for a polyhedron P are
    based on the half-spaces supporting the faces of P. For certain
    kinds of polyhedra this problem is equivalent to the corresponding
    problem for simple polygons in the plane.  We give a new proof that
    the interior of each simple polygon can be represented by a monotone
    boolean formula based on the half-planes supporting the sides of
    the polygon and using each such half-plane only once.  Our main
    contribution is an efficient and practical O(n log n) algorithm
    for doing this boundary-to-CSG conversion for a simple polygon of
    n sides.  We also prove that such nice formulae do not always exist
    for general polyhedra in three dimensions.

    This videotape shows the boundary-to-CSG conversion algorithm in
    action, featuring a visualization created with the Zeus algorithm
    animation system.  Multiple color views, updated as the program
    runs, illustrate different aspects of the algorithm.
