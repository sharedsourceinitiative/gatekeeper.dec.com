<H1>An Efficient Matching Algorithm for a High-Throughput, Low-Latency Data Switch</H1>

This paper focuses on two desired properties of cell-based
switches for digital data net-works: (1) data cells should
not be detained inside the switch any longer than necessary
(the work-conserving property) and (2) data cells that have
been in the switch longer (older cells) should have priority
over younger cells (the order-conserving property).  A
well-known, but expensive design of a work- and 
order-conserving switch is the output-queued switch.
<P>
A different switch design is the speedup crossbar switch, 
in which input buffers are con-nected to output buffers 
through a crossbar that runs at a multiple (called the speedup) 
of the external cell rate.  A matching algorithm determines 
which cells are forwarded through the crossbar at any given 
time.  Previous work has proposed a matching al-go-rithm called 
the lowest output occupancy first algorithm (LOOFA).  It is 
known that a LOOFA switch with speedup at least 2 is work-conserving.
<P>
We propose a refinement of LOOFA called the lowest output 
occupancy and timestamp first algorithm (LOOTFA).  The main 
result of this paper is that a LOOTFA cross-bar switch is 
work- and order-conserving provided that the speedup is at 
least 3.  We prove this result and consider some generalizations.
