Authors' Abstract

    This paper shows how the technique of retiming can be used to
    transform a given synchronous circuit into a more efficient circuit
    under a variety of different cost criteria. We model a circuit
    as a graph, and we give an O(|V|  |E| lg |V|) algorithm for
    determining an equivalent circuit with the smallest possible clock
    period. We show that the problem of determining an equivalent
    retimed circuit with minimum state (total number of registers)
    is polynomial-time solvable. This result yields a polynomial-time
    optimal solution to the problem of pipelining combinational
    circuitry with minimum register cost. We also give a
    characterization of optimal retiming based on an efficiently
    solvable mixed-integer linear programming problem.
