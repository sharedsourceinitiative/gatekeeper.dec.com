<H1>Parallel Compilation on a Tightly Coupled Multiprocessor.</H1>

    This thesis describes a C compiler that runs in parallel on a
    tightly coupled multiprocessor.  The compiler, called  PTCC,
    consists of a two-stage pipeline.  The first stage performs extended
    lexical analysis for the second stage, which does the parsing
    and assembly code generation.  The second stage processes units
    of the source program concurrently.  Units as fine as a single
    statement are compiled in parallel.
<P>
    To avoid unproductive concurrency, a new scheduling abstraction,
    called WorkCrew, is used in  PTCC.  In the WorkCrew model of
    computation, the client creates tasks and specifies how they can
    be subdivided.  WorkCrews favor serial execution when parallel
    execution is unproductive and coarser grains of parallelism over
    finer ones.
<P>
    Several experiments were done to measure the performance of PTCC.
    With 5 processors,  PTCC performed up to 3.3 times better than
    a similar sequential compiler.
