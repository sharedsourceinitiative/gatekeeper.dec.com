     Suppose that we want to eliminate the local go to statements in
     a PASCAL program by replacing them with multilevel loop exit
     statements.  There is a standard technique for doing so that
     succeeds if and only if the flow graph of the PASCAL program
     is reducible.  This technique assumes that we don't allow ourselves
     either to introduce new variables or to replicate code, but that
     we do allow ourselves to reorder the atomic tests and actions
     within the text of the program and to rewrite the connecting
     control structures from scratch.  In this paper, we shall
     investigate the extent to which go tos can be replaced with exits
     while preserving as much as possible of the program's original
     structure.  On the negative side, we shall find that there are
     programs whose flow graphs are reducible but whose go tos cannot
     be eliminated without reordering their tests and actions.  That
     is, programs with go tos can have their atomic elements in some
     weird static order, an order that doesn't correspond in any
     structured way to the dynamic flow of control.  We shall analyze
     this situation by augmenting our flow graphs with edges that
     encode the static order of the atomic elements and then showing
     that the augmented flow graphs of programs with exits are always
     reducible.  On the positive side, given a program with go tos
     whose augmented flow graph is reducible, we shall show that we
     can replace its go tos with exits while preserving essentially
     all of its structure.  In fact, we can simply delete the go to
     statements and the labels they jump to and insert various exit
     statements and labeled Repeat-Endloop pairs for them to jump
     out of, without changing the rest of the program text in any
     way.
