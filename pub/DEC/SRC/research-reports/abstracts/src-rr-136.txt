"A Functional Specification of the Alpha AXP Shared Memory Model"

We give a functional specification of the Alpha AXP architecture 
with special emphasis on the Alpha Shared Memory Model.
We keep the specification as abstract as possible and modular 
in the sense that we provide an independent description of the 
processors and the memory. We show how to handle a number of 
critical aspects of the Alpha architecture within the functional 
model, such as the specification of basic assumptions
about the behavior of the processors and the exclusion of 
causal loops.We use the model for specifying the notion of 
lookahead and shortcut optimization for the behaviors of the 
processors. This allows us to define the concept of correct 
processor behavior by using the conservative sequential behavior 
as a reference. Finally, we extend the model to the constructs for 
synchronization in the Alpha architecture and include the 
instructions "read locked" as well as "store conditional".
