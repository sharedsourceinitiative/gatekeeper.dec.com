CMon is a general-purpose performance monitoring system. It enables
monitoring of long-running programs in a setting where the
experimenters who are interested in the performance data are different
from the users who run the programs that generate the data. Among
other things, this permits programs to be monitored under real
workload conditions. 

PSpec is a language and set of tools for performance assertion checking, 
an approach to automating the testing of performance properties of 
complex systems. It can be used in conjunction with the CMon system to 
produce a performance monitor that runs continuously, over the lifetime 
of a program, and automatically detects performance anomalies. 

In this report we describe the design and implementation of CMon 
and the continuous monitoring features of PSpec, and report on our 
experience using the systems.
