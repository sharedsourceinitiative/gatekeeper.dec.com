Report #152, March 5, 1998. Minor corrections April 22, 1998. 14 pages.

The notion of fairness in trace-based formalisms is examined.  It is
argued that, in general, fairness means machine closure.  The notion
of hyperfairness introduced by Attie, Francez, and Grumberg is
generalized to arbitrary action systems.  Also examined are the
fairness criteria proposed by Apt, Francez, and Katz.
