Authors' abstract:

Although systems for animating algorithms are becoming more powerful
and easier for programmers to use, not enough attention has been 
given to the techniques that an algorithm animator needs to create 
effective visualizations. This paper reviews the techniques for 
algorithm animation reported in the literature thus far and introduces 
new techniques that we have developed for using color and, to a lesser 
extent, sound. The paper also presents six algorithm animations 
that illustrate the new techniques. A videotape of these animations 
is available.
