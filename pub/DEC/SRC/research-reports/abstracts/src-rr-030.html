<H1>The Power of Temporal Proofs.</H1>

<P>
    Some methods for reasoning about concurrent programs and hardware
    devices have been based on proof systems for temporal logic.
    Unfortunately, all effective proof systems for temporal logic
    are incomplete for the standard semantics, in the sense that some
    formulas hold in every intended model but cannot be proved.  We
    evaluate and compare the power of several proof systems for temporal
    logic.  Specifically, we relate temporal systems to classical
    systems with explicit time parameters.
<P>
    A typical temporal system turns out to be incomplete in a strong
    sense;  we exhibit a short, valid formula it fails to prove.  We
    suggest the addition of new rules to define auxiliary predicates.
    With these rules, we obtain nonstandard  soundness and completeness
    results. In particular, one of the simple temporal systems we
    describe is as powerful as Peano Arithmetic.
