"Baby Modula-3 and a Theory of Objects"  
Martin Abadi
February 2, 1993.  43 pages

Baby Modula-3 is a small, functional, object-oriented programming
language.  It is intended as a vehicle for explaining the core
of Modula-3, from a biased perspective: Baby Modula-3 includes
the main features of Modula-3 related to objects, but not much
else. To the theoretician, Baby Modula-3 provides a tractable, concrete 
example of an object-oriented language, and we use it to study the
formal semantics of objects.

Baby Modula-3 is defined with a structured operational semantics and 
with a set of static type rules. A denotational semantics guarantees 
the soundness of this definition.
