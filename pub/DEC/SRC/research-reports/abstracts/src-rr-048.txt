Authors' Abstract

    We define a simple collection of operations for creating and
    manipulating record structures, where records are intended as finite
    associations of values to labels.  A second-order type system over
    these operations supports both subtyping and polymorphism.  We
    provide typechecking algorithms and limited semantic models.

    Our approach unifies and extends previous notions of records,
    bounded quantification, record extension, and parameterization by
    row-variables.  The general aim is to provide foundations for
    concepts found in object-oriented languages, within a framework
    based on typed lambda-calculus.
