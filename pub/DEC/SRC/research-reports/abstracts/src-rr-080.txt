Authors' abstract

System F is a well-known typed l-calculus with polymorphic types, which
provides a basis for polymorphic programming languages.  We study an
extension of F, called F<:J(pronouncedJef-sub) that combines parametric
polymorphism with subtyping.

The main focus of the paper is the equational theory of F<:J, which
is related to PER models and the notion of parametricity.  We study
some categorical properties of the theory when restricted to closed
terms, including interesting categorical isomorphisms.  We also
investigate proof-theoretical properties, such as the conservativity
of typing judgments with respect to F.

We demonstrate by a set of examples how a range of constructs may be
encoded in F<:J.  These include record operations and subtyping
hierarchies that are related to features of object-oriented languages.
