Authors' Abstract

    This paper addresses some of the problems of using Modula-2 to
    develop large programs, that is, programs with more detail than
    can be managed effectively by one person. The primary weaknesses
    of Modula-2 for building large systems of concurrent applications
    that share data structures and code are discussed.  A collection
    of language changes and extensions to strengthen Modula-2 for
    such applications are described. Experience using the extended
    language for a large software project suggests that it is good
    for the cooperative development of large, experimental programs
    that share memory.
