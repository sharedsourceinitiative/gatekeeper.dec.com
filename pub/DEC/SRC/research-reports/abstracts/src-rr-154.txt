"Protection in Programming-Language Translations"

Report #154, April 17, 1998.
21 pages.

We discuss abstractions for protection and the correctness of 
their implementations. Relying on the concept of full abstraction, 
we consider two examples: (1) the translation of Java classes to 
an intermediate bytecode language, and (2) in the setting of the 
pi calculus, the implementation of private channels in terms of
cryptographic operations.
