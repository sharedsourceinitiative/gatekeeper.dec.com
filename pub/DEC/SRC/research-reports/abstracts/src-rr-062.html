<H1>Subtyping Recursive Types</H1>

We investigate the interactions of subtyping and recursive
types in a simply typed lambda-calculus. The two fundamental questions here
are whether two (recursive) types are in the subtype relation and whether
a term has a type.
<P>
        To address the first question, we relate various definitions of
type equivalence and subtyping that are induced by a model, an
ordering on infinite trees, an algorithm, and a set of type rules. We
show soundness and completeness between the rules, the algorithm, and
the tree semantics. We also prove soundness and a restricted form of
completeness for the model.
<P>
        To address the second question, we show that to every pair of
types in the subtype relation we can associate a term whose denotation is
the uniquely determined coercion map between the two types. Moreover,
we derive an algorithm that, given a term with implicit coercions, can
infer its least type whenever possible.
