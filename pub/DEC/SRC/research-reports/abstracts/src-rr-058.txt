"Report on the Larch Shared Language: Version 2.3"
John V. Guttag, James J. Horning, Andres Modet
 April 14, 1990.  43 pages

Authors' abstract
The Larch family of languages is used to specify program interfaces in a
two-tiered definitional style.  Each Larch specification has components written
in two languages: one that is designed for a specific programming language
and another that is independent of any programming language.  The former are
the Larch interface languages, and the latter is the Larch Shared
Language (LSL).  Version 2.3 of LSL is similar to previous versions, but
contains a number of refinements based on experience writing specifications
and developing tools to support the specification process.  This report
contains an informal introduction and a self-contained language definition.


This report supersedes Pieces II and III of Larch in Five Easy
Pieces, SRC Report 5, by J. Guttag, J. Horning, and J. Wing.
