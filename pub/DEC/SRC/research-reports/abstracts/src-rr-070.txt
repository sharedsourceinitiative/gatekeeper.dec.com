Authors' abstract

  We study some of the concepts, protocols, and algorithms for access
 control in distributed systems, from a logical perspective.  We account
 for how a principal may come to believe that another principal is
 making a request, either on his own or on someone else's behalf.  We
 also provide a logical language for access control lists, and theories
 for deciding whether requests should be granted.
