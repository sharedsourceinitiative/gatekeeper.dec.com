<H1>Bridges: Tools to Extend the Vesta Configuration Management System</H1>
<HR>

Vesta is a highly flexible configuration management system that
supports large-scale development. Vesta provides a repository of 
immutable objects and a functional programming language for writing 
concise yet complete descriptions of configurations.
<P>
A Vesta bridge is a set of related functions and data types provided by
tool builders to a Vesta environment. For instance, a C bridge might 
include a function for compiling C sources and a function for linking 
compiled C sources into executable images.
<P>
Vesta has supported development on a significant scale. The Vesta
prototype included several low-aspiration bridges that encapsulated 
existing tools without modification; these bridges were straightforward 
to write. Vesta also included one high-aspiration bridge, Vulcan, a 
compiler server based on abstract-syntax trees. Vulcan gained both 
functionality and performance from its integration with Vesta. Both types 
of bridge benefited from Vesta's single, uniform naming facility that 
replaced ad hoc name spaces of traditional environments.
<P>
Bridges themselves are described and configured within Vesta. This
allows tool builders to provide consistent collections of tools, control 
their evolution, and manage their installation using Vesta.
