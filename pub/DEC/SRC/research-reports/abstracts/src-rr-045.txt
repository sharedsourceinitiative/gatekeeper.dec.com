Author's Abstract

    There exists an identifiable programming style based on the 
    widespread use of type information handled through mechanical 
    typechecking techniques.

    This typeful programming style is in a sense independent of the 
    language it is embedded in;  it adapts equally well to functional, 
    imperative, object-oriented, and algebraic programming, and it 
    is not incompatible with relational and concurrent programming.  

    The main purpose of this paper is to show how typeful programming 
    is best supported by sophisticated type systems, and how these 
    systems can help in clarifying programming issues and in adding 
    power and regularity to languages.
