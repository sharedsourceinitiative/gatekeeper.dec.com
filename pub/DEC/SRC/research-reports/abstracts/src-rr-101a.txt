Computational geometry concepts are often easiest to understand visually, 
in terms of the geometric objects they manipulate. Indeed, most papers in 
the field rely on diagrams to communicate the intuition behind their
results. However, static figures are not always adequate.

The accompanying videotape showcases advances in the use of algorithm 
animation, visualization, and interactive computing in the study of
computational geometry. This report contains brief descriptions of 
all the segments of the videotape. The eight segments in the video cover 
a wide range of geometric concepts and software systems. The segments have 
been prepared by researchers at eight different institutions.

A videotape (101b) accompanies report 101a:
