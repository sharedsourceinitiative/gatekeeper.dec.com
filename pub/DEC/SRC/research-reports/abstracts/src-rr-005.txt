Authors' Abstract

    The Larch Project is developing tools and techniques intended
    to aid in the productive use of formal specifications.  A major
    part of the Larch Project is a family of specification languages.
    Each Larch specification has one component written in a language
    derived from a programming language and another component written
    in a language independent of any programming language.  We call
    the former "Larch interface languages" and the latter the "Larch
    Shared Language."  We have gathered together five documents about
    the Larch family of languages: an overview, an informal description
    of the Shared Language, a reference manual for the Shared Language,
    a handbook of specifications written in the Shared Language, and
    a report on using Larch/CLU, which is one of the interface
    languages.
