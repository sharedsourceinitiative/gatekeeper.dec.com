In dynamic graph algorithms the following provide-or-bound problem has
to be solved quickly: Given a set S containing a subset R and a way of
generating random elements from S testing for membership in R, either
(i) provide an element of R or (ii) give a (small) upper bound on the
size of R that holds with high probability.  We give an optimal
algorithm for this problem.

This algorithm improves the time per operation for various dyamic graph
algorithms by a factor of O(log n). For example, it improves the
time per update for fully dynamic connectivity from O(log^3n) to
O(log^2 n).
