We introduce a new genre of user interface applications that can 
migrate from one machine to another, taking their user interface and 
application contexts with them, and continue from where they left off. 
Such applications are not tied to one user or one machine, and can 
roam freely over the network, rendering service to a community of 
users, gathering human input and interacting with people. We envisage 
that this will support many new agent-based collaboration metaphors. 
The ability to migrate executing programs has applicability to mobile 
computing as well. Users can have their applications travel with them, 
as they move from one computing environment to another. We present 
an elegant programming model for creating migratory applications and 
describe an implementation. The biggest strength of our implementation 
is that the details of migration are completely hidden from the 
application programmer; arbitrary user interface applications can be 
migrated by a single "migration" command. We address system issues 
such as robustness, persistence and memory usage, and also human 
factors relating to application design, the interaction metaphor 
and safety.
