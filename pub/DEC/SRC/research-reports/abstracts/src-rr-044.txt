Authors' Abstract

    We present a theorem for deriving properties of a concurrent 
    program by reasoning about a simpler, coarser-grained version.  
    The theorem generalizes a result that Lipton proved for partial 
    correctness and deadlock-freedom.  Our theorem applies to all 
    safety properties.
