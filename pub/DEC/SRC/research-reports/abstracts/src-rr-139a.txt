"WebCard: Integrated and Uniform Access to Mail, News, and the Web"
Marc H. Brown
Report #139a, July 15, 1996. 10 pages.


This report describes WebCard, an integrated mail/news reader and Web
browser.  As a mail/news reader, WebCard is fairly conventional; the
innovation is that Web pages are fully integrated into the mail/news
reader. The user interface is based on folders, which can contain mail
messages, news articles or Web pages.  Folders can be used to organize
material and to present the pages returned by commands such as
"search" and "auto surf."

A videotape (139b) associated with this work is available.
