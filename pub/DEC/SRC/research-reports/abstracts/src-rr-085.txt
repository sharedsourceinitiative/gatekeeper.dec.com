Authors' abstract

We have incorporated on-line data compression into the low levels of a
log-structured file system (Rosenblum's Sprite LFS).  Each
block of data or meta-data is compressed as it is written to the disk
and decompressed as it is read.   The log-structuring overcomes the
problems of allocation and fragmentation for variable-sized blocks.  We
observe compression factors ranging from 1.6 to 2.2, using algorithms
running from 1.7 to 0.4 MBytes per second in software on a DECstation
5000/200.  System performance is degraded by a few percent for normal
activities (such as compiling or editing), and as much as a factor of
1.6 for file system intensive operations (such as copying
multi-megabyte files).

Hardware compression devices mesh well with this design.  Chips are
already available that operate at speeds exceeding disk transfer rates,
which indicates that hardware compression would not only remove the
performance degradation we observed, but might well increase the
effective disk transfer rate beyond that obtainable from a system
without compression.
