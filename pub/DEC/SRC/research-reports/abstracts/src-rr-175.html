The Connectivity Server is a special-purpose database whose schema models 
the Web as a graph graph where URLs are nodes and hyperlinks are directed 
edges. The Link Database provides fast access to the hyperlinks. To support 
a wide range of graph algorithms, we find it important to fit the Link 
Database into memory. In the first version of the Link Database, we achieved 
this fit by using machines with lots of memory (8GB), and storing each 
hyperlink in 32 bits. However, this approach was limited to roughly 100 
million Web pages. This paper presents techniques to compress the links 
to accommodate larger graphs. Our techniques combine well-known compression 
methods with methods that depend on the properties of the web graph. The 
first compression technique takes advantage of the fact that most hyperlinks 
on most Web pages point to other pages on the same host as the page itself.  
The second technique takes advantage of the fact that many pages on the 
same host share hyperlinks, that is, they tend to point to a common set 
of pages. Together, these techniques reduce space requirements to under 
6 bits per link. While (de)compression adds latency to the hyperlink access 
time, we can still compute the strongly connected components of a 6 
billion-edge graph in under 20 minutes and run applications such as 
Kleinberg's HITS in real time. This paper describes our techniques for 
compressing the Link Database, and provides performance numbers for 
compression ratios and decompression speed.
