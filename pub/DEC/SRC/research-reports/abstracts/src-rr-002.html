    Point location, often known in graphics as "hit detection," is
    one of the fundamental problems of computational geometry.  In
    a point location query we want to identify which of a given
    collection of geometric objects contains a particular point.  Let
    S  denote a subdivision of the Euclidean plane into monotone
    regions by a straight-line graph of  m  edges.  In this paper
    we exhibit a substantial refinement of the technique of Lee and
    Preparata for locating a point in  S  based on separating chains.
    The new data structure, called a layered dag, can be built in
    O(m) time, uses O(m) storage, and makes possible point location
    in O(log m) time.  Unlike previous structures that attain these
    optimal bounds, the layered dag can be implemented in a simple
    and practical way, and is extensible to subdivisions with edges
    more general than straight-line segments.
