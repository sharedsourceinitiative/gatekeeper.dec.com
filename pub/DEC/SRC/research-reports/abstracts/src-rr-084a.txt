A fisheye camera lens is a very wide angle lens that magnifies nearby
objects while shrinking distant objects.  It is a valuable tool for
seeing both "local detail" and "global context" simultaneously.  This
paper describes a system for viewing and browsing graphs using a
software analog of a fisheye lens.  We first show how to implement such
a view using solely geometric transformations.  We then describe a more
general transformation that allows hierarchical or structured
information about the graph to affect the view. Our general
transformation is a fundamental extension to previous research in fisheye views.

In SRC Research Report #84 also entitled "Graphical Fisheye Views of
Graphs" by Manojit Sarkar and Marc H. Brown, a system for viewing and
browsing graphs using a software fisheye lens was described. Such a
lens shows nearby objects large and with detail, while shrinking
distant objects. It is a valuable tool for seeing both "local detail"
and "global context" simultaneously. This videotape shows the system in 
action.
