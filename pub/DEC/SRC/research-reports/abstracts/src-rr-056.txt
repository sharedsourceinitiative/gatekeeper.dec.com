Authors' abstract

  We investigate the use of the dot notation in the context of
 abstract types. The dot notation---that is, a.f referring to the
 operation f provided by the abstraction a---is used by programming
 languages such as Modula-2 and CLU. We compare this notation with 
 the  Mitchell-Plotkin approach, which draws a parallel between 
 type abstraction and (weak) existential quantification in 
 constructive logic. The basic operations on existentials coming from 
 logic give new insights about the meaning of type abstraction, but 
 differ completely from the more familiar dot notation. In this paper,
 we formalize simple calculi equipped with the dot notation, and relate 
 them to  a more classical calculus `a la Mitchell and Plotkin. This work 
 provides some theoretical foundations for the dot notation, and suggests 
 some useful extensions.
