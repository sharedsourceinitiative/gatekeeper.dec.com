"The Vesta Approach to Precise Configuration of Large Software Systems"
Roy Levin, Paul R. McJones
38 pages


The problems of software configuration and release management limit the
size of systems that we can build efficiently. Today's large systems strain 
the capabilities of traditional development tools. The Vesta system provides 
a novel repository and system builder that emphasize complete yet
manageable descriptions of software components. These facilities enable 
Vesta to eliminate much of the manual and error-prone drudgery of system
construction without enforcing a particular methodology on its users.
This paper presents an overview of Vesta, followed by a series of
detailed examples that illustrate how Vesta's facilities simplify the
development of large systems. These examples are drawn from a year's use 
of Vesta by a group of about 25 researchers developing a rapidly
changing software system of over 1.4 million source lines. That experience clearly
demonstrates the power and practicality of the Vesta approach and its
advantages over conventional tools.
