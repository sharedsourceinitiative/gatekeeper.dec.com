    "win and sin:  Predicate Transformers for Concurrency."
    Leslie Lamport.
    May 1, 1987.  30 pages.

Author's Abstract

    Dijkstra's  weakest liberal precondition and strongest postcondition
    predicate transformers are generalized to the weakest invariant
    and strongest invariant.  These new predicate transformers are
    useful for reasoning about concurrent programs containing operations
    in which the grain of atomicity is unspecified.  They can also
    be used to replace behavioral arguments with more rigorous
    assertional ones.
