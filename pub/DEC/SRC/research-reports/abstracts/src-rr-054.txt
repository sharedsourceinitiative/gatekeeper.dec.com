Authors' abstract

    The lambda,sigma-calculus is a refinement of the lambda-calculus
    where substitutions are manipulated explicitly. The lambda,sigma-calculus
    provides a setting for studying the theory of substitutions, with
    pleasant mathematical properties. It is also a useful bridge between
    the classical lambda-calculus and concrete implementations.
