    Replication is an important technique for increasing computer 
    system availability.  In this paper, we present an algorithm for 
    replicating stored data on multiple server machines.  The algorithm 
    organizes the replicated servers in a master/slaves scheme, with 
    one master election being performed at the beginning of each 
    service period.  The status of each replica is summarized by a 
    set of monotonically increasing epoch variables.  Examining the 
    epoch variables of a majority of the replicas reveals which 
    replicas have up-to-date data.  The set of replicas can be changed 
    dynamically.  Replicas that have been off-line can be brought 
    up to date in background, and witness replicas, which store the 
    epoch variables but not the data, can participate in the majority 
    voting.  The algorithm does not require distributed atomic 
    transactions.  The algorithm also permits client machines to cache 
    copies of data, with strict cache consistency being ensured by 
    having the replicated servers keep track of which clients have 
    cached what data.  The work reported in this paper is part of 
    an ongoing project to build a new replicated distributed file 
    system with client caching, called Echo.
