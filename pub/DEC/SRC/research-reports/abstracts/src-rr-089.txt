Author's abstract:

We use functional specification techniques to describe systems and 
their components. We define the notions of property refinement and
interaction refinement for interactive systems and their components.
Interaction refinement allows changes to the syntactic interface (the 
number of channels and the sorts of messages on the channels) as well 
as the semantic interface (causality flow between messages and
interaction granularity). We prove that these notions of refinement
are compositional with respect to sequential and parallel composition,
communication feedback, and recursive declarations of system
components. These proofs demonstrate that refinements of networks can
be accomplished in a modular way by refining their components. We
generalize the notions of refinement to refining contexts. Finally, we
define full abstraction for specifications and show compositionality
with respect to this abstraction as well.
