Obliq-3D is an interpreted language that is embedded into the 3D
animation system Anim3D.  Anim3D is based on a few simple, yet
powerful constructs that allow a programmer to describe
three-dimensional scenes and animations of such scenes.  Obliq-3D, by
virtue of its interpretive nature, provides the programmer with a
fast turnaround environment.  The combination of simplicity and fast
turnaround allows application programmers to construct non-trivial
animations quickly and easily.

The first half of this report contains a tutorial to Obliq-3D, which
develops the various concepts of the animation system.  The second
part contains a reference manual, which describes the functionality of
Obliq-3D module by module.
