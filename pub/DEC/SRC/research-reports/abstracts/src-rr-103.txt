Extensive caching is a key feature of the Echo distributed file system.
Echo client machines maintain coherent caches of file and directory data 
and properties, with write-behind (delayed write-back) of all cached
information. Echo specifies ordering constraints on this write-behind, 
enabling applications to store and maintain consistent data structures
in the file system even when crashes or network faults prevent some writes 
from being completed. In this paper we describe the Echo cache's coherence 
and ordering semantics, show how they can improve the performance and
consistency of applications, and explain how they are implemented. We also 
discuss the general problem of reliably notifying applications and users
when write-behind is lost; we addressed this problem as part of the Echo 
design but did not find a fully satisfactory solution.
