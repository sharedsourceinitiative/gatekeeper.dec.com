Authors' abstract

Aleliunas et al. posed the following question: "The reachability problem for 
undirected graphs can be solved in logspace and 0(mn) time [m is the number of
edges and n is the number of vertices] by a probabilistic algorithm that 
simulates a random walk, or in linear time and space by a conventional
deterministic graph traversal algorithm. Is there a spectrum of time-space
trade-offs between these extremes?" We answer this question in the 
affirmative for graphs with a linear number of edges by presenting an 
algorithm that is faster than the random walk by a factor essentially 
proportional to the size of its workspace. For denser graphs, our algorithm
is faster than the random walk but the speed-up factor is smaller.
