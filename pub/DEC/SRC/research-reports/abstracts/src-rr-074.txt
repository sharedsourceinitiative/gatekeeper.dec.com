Authors' abstract

This report is aimed primarily at the C programmer who wishes to begin
to integrate formal specifications into the program development cycle.
We present a specification language  targeted specifically at C and
discuss how it can be used to support a style of C programming in which
abstraction plays a vital role.

The report begins with a quick overview of the use of the Larch family of
languages for program specification.  It continues with an overview of LCL,
a Larch interface language for (ANSI) standard C. It then describes LCL by
means of an extended example.  Parts of an implementation of the specified
interfaces are provided in the body of the report.  The remaining parts of
the implementation are presented in an appendix.  Another appendix contains
a brief introduction to the Larch Shared Language.
