Authors' Abstract

    Refinement mappings are used to prove that a lower-level
    specification correctly implements a higher-level one.  We consider
    specifications consisting of a state machine (which may be
    infinite-state) that specifies safety requirements, and an arbitrary
    supplementary property that specifies liveness requirements.  A
    refinement mapping from a lower-level specification S_{1} to a
    higher-level one S_{2} is a mapping from S_{1}'s state space to
    S_{2}'s state space. It maps steps of S_{1}'s state machine  to
    steps of  S_{2}'s state machine and maps behaviors allowed by
    S_{1} to behaviors allowed by S_{2}.  We show that, under reasonable
    assumptions about the specifications, if  S_{1} implements S_{2},
    then by adding auxiliary variables to S_{1} we can guarantee the
    existence of a refinement mapping.  This provides a completeness
    result for a practical, hierarchical specification method.
