"The Temporal Logic of Actions"
Leslie Lamport
December 25, 1991.  88 pages

Author's abstract

The temporal logic of actions (TLA) is a logic for specifying and
reasoning about concurrent systems. Systems and their properties are
represented in the same logic, so the assertion that a system meets
its specification and the assertion that one system implements another
are both expressed by logical implication. TLA is very simple; its
syntax and complete formal semantics are summarized in a little over
a page. Yet, TLA is not just a logician's toy; it is extremely
powerful, both in principle and in practice. This report introduces
TLA and describes how it is used to specify and verify concurrent
algorithms. The use of TLA to specify and reason about open systems
will be described elsewhere.
