Abstract
<P>
Current technology trends make it possible to build communication
networks that can support high performance distributed computing.  
This paper describes issues in the design of a prototype switch for an
arbitrary topology point-to-point network with link speeds of up to 
one gigabit per second. The switch deals in fixed-length ATM-style 
cells, which it can process at a rate of 37 million cells per second.  
It provides high bandwidth and low latency for datagram traffic.  
In addition, it supports real-time traffic by providing bandwidth 
reservations with guaranteed latency bounds. The key to the switch's 
operation is a technique called "parallel iterative matching," which 
can quickly identify a set of conflict-free cells for transmission in a 
time slot. Bandwidth reservations are accommodated in the switch by
building a fixed schedule for transporting cells from reserved flows
across the switch; parallel iterative matching can fill unused slots 
with datagram traffic.  Finally, we note that parallel iterative matching 
may not allocate bandwidth fairly among flows of datagram traffic.  We 
describe a technique called "statistical matching", which can be used to 
ensure fairness at the switch and to support applications with
rapidly changing needs for guaranteed bandwidth.
