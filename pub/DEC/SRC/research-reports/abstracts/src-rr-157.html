The Virtual Book Project explored the use of a prototype electronic reading 
appliance to replace paper as the medium for reading and browsing a wide 
variety of material. The research hypothesis was that the relevant 
technologies for high-resolution flat panel displays and the associated 
storage, processing and communication components were reaching thresholds 
that enabled them to compete successfully with paper for sustained reading. 
Our research strategy was to build and deploy a dozen prototype units, 
gaining hands-on experience with the issues involved in their use.
<P>
Our experience with the Lectrice prototype shows that reading appliances 
are indeed crossing the threshold to practicality, but that a number of 
challenges remain to make these devices fully competitive with some of 
the more subtle advantages of paper. At the same time, the inherent 
advantages of electronic media make the long-term prospects for reading 
appliances very compelling.
<P>
This report describes Lectrice, summarizes the lessons learned about both 
software and hardware, and poses some of the questions that need to be 
addressed for the promise of reading appliances to be fully realized.
