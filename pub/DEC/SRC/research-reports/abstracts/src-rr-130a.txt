"Visual Obliq: A System for Building Distributed, Multi-User
Applications by Direct Manipulation"
Krishna Bharat and Marc H. Brown
October 31, 1995. 29 pages.

This report describes Visual Obliq, a user interface development
environment for constructing distributed, multi-user
applications. Applications are created by designing the interface with
a GUI-builder and embedding callback code in an interpreted language,
in much the same way as one would build a traditional
(non-distributed, single-user) application with a modern user
interface development environment.  The resulting application can be
run from within the GUI-builder for rapid turnaround or as a
stand-alone executable.  The Visual Obliq runtime provides
abstractions and support for issues specific to distributed computing,
such as replication, sharing, communication, and session
management. We believe that the abstractions provided, the simplicity
of the programming model, the rapid turnaround time, and the
applicability to heterogeneous environments, make Visual Obliq a
viable tool for authoring distributed applications and groupware.
