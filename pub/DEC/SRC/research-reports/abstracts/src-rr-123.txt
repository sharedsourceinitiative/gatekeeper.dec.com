Over a period of two and a half years, a team from the Systems
Research Center designed, built, and revised a set of software
tools for the dictionary division of Oxford University Press. Many 
aspects of this project were novel, including the approach to 
lexicography, the software environment, the problems of scale, and 
the demands of high performance and high reliability. In this paper, 
two members of the team describe some of the systems problems they 
faced in building these tools, and the solutions they devised to 
solve them.
