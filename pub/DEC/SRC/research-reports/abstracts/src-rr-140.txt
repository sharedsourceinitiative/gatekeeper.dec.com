"Zippers: A Focus+Context Display of Web Pages"
Marc H. Brown and William E. Weihl
Report #140, May 22, 1996. 8 pages.

This report describes zippers, an application of
outline-processor technology to the display of Web pages. Zippers
allow users to expand and contract selected sections of a document,
thereby displaying simultaneously the contents of individual sections
of a document as well as its overall structure. Zippers can be 
implemented either directly in a Web browser or by a proxy (and 
consequently used by any off-the-shelf Web browser); in either case, 
no changes to HTML source files are required.
