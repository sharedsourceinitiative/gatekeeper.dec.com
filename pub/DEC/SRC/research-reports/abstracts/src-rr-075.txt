Marc H. Brown
February 28, 1992.  21 pages

Author's abstract:

Algorithm animation is a form of program visualization that is 
concerned with dynamic and interactive graphical displays of a 
program's fundamental operations. This paper describes the Zeus 
algorithm animation system. Zeus is noteworthy for its use of objects, 
strong-typing, and parallelism. Also of interest is how the system 
can be used for building multi-view editors.
