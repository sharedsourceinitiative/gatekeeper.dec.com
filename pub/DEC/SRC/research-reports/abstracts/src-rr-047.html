    Statically typed programming languages allow earlier error 
    checking, better enforcement of disciplined programming styles, 
    and generation of more efficient object code than languages where 
    all type-consistency checks are performed at run time.  However, 
    even in statically typed languages, there is often the need to 
    deal with data whose type cannot be determined at compile time.  
    To handle such situations safely, we propose to add a type  
    Dynamic  whose values are pairs of a value  v  and a type tag  
    T  where  v  has the type denoted by  T.  Instances of  Dynamic  
    are built with an explicit tagging construct and inspected with 
    a type-safe  typecase  construct.

    This paper explores the syntax, operational semantics, and 
    denotational semantics of a simple language with the type Dynamic.  
    We give examples of how dynamically typed values can be used in 
    programming.  Then, we discuss an operational semantics for our 
    language and obtain a soundness theorem.  We present two 
    formulations of the denotational semantics of this language and 
    relate them to the operational semantics.  Finally, we consider 
    the implications of polymorphism and some implementation issues.
