Author's Abstract

    Traditionally, C programmers have used specially designated return 
    codes to indicate exception conditions arising during program 
    execution. More modern languages offer alternative mechanisms 
    that integrate exception handling into the control structure. 
    This approach has several advantages over the use of return codes: 
    it increases the likelihood that programming errors will be 
    detected, makes it easier to structure the specification of an 
    abstraction, and improves the readability of the implementation 
    by providing better syntactic separation between handling of 
    conventional and exceptional cases. This paper describes a set 
    of language extensions to support exception handling in C, and 
    a preprocessor-based implementation of those extensions that 
    demonstrates both the feasibility and the portability of this 
    approach.
