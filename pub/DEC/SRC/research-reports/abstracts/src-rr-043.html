<H1>Performance of Firefly RPC.</H1>
<HR>
<H2>    Michael D. Schroeder and Michael Burrows.</H2>
<b>April 15, 1989</b><BR><i> 17 pages</i>
<P>
    In this paper, we report on the performance of the remote procedure 
    call implementation for the Firefly multiprocessor and analyze 
    the implementation to account precisely for all measured latency.  
    From the analysis and measurements, we estimate how much faster 
    RPC could be if certain improvements were made.
<P>
    The elapsed time for an inter-machine call to a remote procedure 
    that accepts no arguments and produces no results is 2.66 
    milliseconds.  The elapsed time for an RPC that has a single 
    1440-byte result (the maximum result that will fit in a single 
    packet) is 6.35 milliseconds.  Maximum inter-machine throughput 
    using RPC is 4.65 megabits/second, achieved with 4 threads making 
    parallel RPCs that return the maximum sized single packet result.  
    CPU utilization at maximum throughput is about 1.2 on the calling 
    machine and a little less on the server.  
<P>
    These measurements are for RPCs from user space on one machine 
    to user space on another, using the installed system and a 10 
    megabit/second Ethernet.  The RPC packet exchange protocol is 
    built on IP/UDP, and the times include calculating and verifying 
    UDP checksums.  The Fireflies used in the tests had 5 MicroVAX 
    II processors and a DEQNA Ethernet controller.
