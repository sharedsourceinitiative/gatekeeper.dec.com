"Animation of Geometric Algorithms: A Video Review"

June 6, 1992.  23 pages.

Geometric algorithms and data structures are often easiest to understand
visually, in terms of the geometric objects they manipulate.  Indeed,
most papers in computational geometry rely on diagrams to communicate
the intuition behind the results. Algorithm animation uses dynamic
visual images to explain algorithms. Thus it is natural to present
geometric algorithms, which are inherently dynamic, via algorithm
animation.

This videotape presents a video review of geometric animations; the
review was premiered at the 1992 ACM Symposium on Computational
Geometry.  The review includes single-algorithm animations and sample
graphic displays from ``workbench'' systems for implementing multiple
geometric algorithms.  The accompanying report contains short
descriptions of the algorithm, animation, and implementation techniques
used in each video segment.
