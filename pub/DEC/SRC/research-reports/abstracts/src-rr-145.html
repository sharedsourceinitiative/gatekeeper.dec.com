<H1>Modularity in the Presence of Subclassing</H1>

<b>Report #145, April 28, 1997</b><BR><i>98 pages</i>
<P>
Classes are harder to subclass than they need be.  This report
addresses this problem, showing how to design classes that are more
modular and easier to subclass without sacrificing the extensibility
that makes subclassing useful to begin with.
<P>
We argue that a class should have two interfaces, an "instance
interface" used by programmers manipulating instances of the class,
and a "specialization interface" used by programmers building
subclasses of the class.  Instance interfaces are relatively well
understood, but design principles for specialization interfaces
are not.
<P>
In the context of single inheritance, we argue that specialization
interfaces should be partitioned into "class components".  A class
component groups part of a class's state together with methods to
maintain that state.  Class components establish abstraction
boundaries within classes, allowing modular replacement of
components by subclasses.  Achieving this replaceability requires
reasoning about each component as an independent unit that depends
only on the specifications of other components and not on their
implementations.
<P>
We introduce the concept of "abstract representation" to denote
the view of a class's state given in its specialization interface.
This view is more detailed than the view used to describe instances of
the class, revealing details that describe the interfaces between
class components.  It is less detailed than the actual implementation,
hiding implementation details that should not be exposed even to
specializers.
<P>
We also consider multiple inheritance, specifically, Snyder's model of
encapsulated multiple inheritance.  We advocate separating class
components into individual classes called "mixins".  Instantiable
classes are built by combining multiple mixins.  With the mixin style
of design, class hierarchies have more classes than in equivalent
single-inheritance designs.  These classes have smaller, simpler
interfaces and can be reused more flexibly.
<P>
To explore the impact our ideas might have on program design, we
consider classes from existing libraries in light of the proposed
single- and multiple-inheritance methodologies.  To explore the
impact our ideas might have on language design, we present two
different extensions to Java, one that provides a level of static
checking for single-inheritance designs, and another that adds the
encapsulated model of multiple inheritance.
