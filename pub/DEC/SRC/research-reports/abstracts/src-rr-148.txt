Report #148, June 1, 1997. 15 pages.

The World-Wide Web is rich in content and services, but access to 
these resources must be obtained mostly through manual browsers. We 
would like to be able to write programs that reproduce human browsing 
behavior, including reactions to slow transmission-rates and failures 
on many simultaneous links. We thus introduce a concurrent model that 
directly incorporates the notions of failure and rate of communication, 
and then describe programming constructs based on this model.
