Author's Abstract

    Type theory has been used in organizing and clarifying programming
    language features. As such features become more complex we will
    need more advanced and powerful type systems like Martin-Loef's
    intuitionistic theory of types.

    This paper investigates the use of such powerful type systems
    from a programming language perspective.  To satisfy language
    design needs, these type systems must be extended so that their
    ordinary semantic theories are no longer applicable.  A semantics
    is developed that justifies the extensions of Martin-Loef's type
    system with recursion and the Type:Type property.
