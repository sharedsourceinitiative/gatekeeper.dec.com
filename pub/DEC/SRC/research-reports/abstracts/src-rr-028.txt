    "A Theorem on Atomicity in Distributed Algorithms."

Author's Abstract

    Reasoning about a distributed algorithm is simplified if we can
    ignore the time needed to send and deliver messages and can instead
    pretend that a process sends a collection of messages as a single
    atomic action, with the messages delivered instantaneously as
    part of the action.  A theorem is derived that proves the validity
    of such reasoning for a large class of algorithms.  It generalizes
    and corrects a well known folk theorem about when an operation
    in a multiprocess program can be considered atomic.
