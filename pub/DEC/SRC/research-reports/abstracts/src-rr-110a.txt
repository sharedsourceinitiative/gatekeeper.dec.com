This report describes a variety of 3D interactive graphics techniques
for visualizing programs. The third dimension provides an extra degree
of freedom for conveying information, much as color adds to
black-and-white images, animation adds to static images, and sound
adds to silent animations. The examples in this report illustrate three
fundamental uses of 3D: for providing additional information about
objects that are intrinsically two-dimensional, for uniting multiple
views, and for capturing a history of execution. The application of
dynamic three-dimensional graphics to program visualization is largely
unexplored.

A videotape (110b) of these animations is available:
