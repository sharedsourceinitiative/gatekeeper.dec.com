Autonet is a self-configuring local area network composed of switches 
interconnected by 100 Mbit/second, full-duplex, point-to-point links.  
The switches contain 12 ports that are internally connected by a full 
crossbar.  Switches use cut-through to achieve a packet forwarding 
latency as low as 2 microseconds per switch.  Any switch port can 
be cabled to any other switch port or to a host network controller.

A processor in each switch monitors the network's physical 
configuration.  A distributed algorithm running on the switch 
processors computes the routes packets are to follow and fills in 
the packet forwarding table in each switch.  This algorithm 
automatically recalculates the forwarding tables to incorporate 
repaired or new links and switches, and to bypass links and switch 
that have failed or been removed.  Host network controllers have 
alternate ports to the network and fail over if the active port stops 
working.

With Autonet, distinct paths through the set of network links can 
carry packets in parallel.  Thus, in a suitable physical configuration, 
many pairs of hosts can communicate simultaneously at full link 
bandwidth.  The aggregate bandwidth of an Autonet can be increased 
by adding more links and switches.  Each switch can handle up to 2 
million packets/per second. Coaxial links can span 100 meters and 
fiber links can span 2 kilometers.

A 30-switch network with more than 100 hosts is the service network 
for Digital's Systems Research Center.
