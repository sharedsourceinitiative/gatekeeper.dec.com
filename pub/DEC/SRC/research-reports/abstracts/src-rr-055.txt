Authors' abstract
  Quest is a programming language based on impredicative type 
  quantifiers and subtyping within a three-level structure of kinds, 
  types and type operators, and values.
  
  The semantics of Quest is rather challenging. In particular, 
  difficulties arise when we try to model simultaneously features 
  such as contravariant function spaces, record types, subtyping,
  recursive types, and fixpoints.

  In this paper we describe in detail the type inference rules for
  Quest, and we give them meaning using a partial equivalence relation 
  model of types. Subtyping is interpreted as in previous work by 
  Bruce and Longo, but the interpretation of some aspects, namely 
  subsumption, power kinds, and record subtyping, is novel. The latter
  is based on a new encoding of record types.

  We concentrate on modeling quantifiers and subtyping; recursion 
  is the subject of current work.
