    In a shared-memory multiprocessor with private caches, cached 
    copies of a data item must be kept consistent.  This is called 
    cache coherence.  Both hardware and software coherence schemes 
    have been proposed.  Software techniques are attractive because 
    they avoid hardware complexity and can be used with any 
    processor-memory interconnection.  This paper presents an 
    analytical model of the performance of two software coherence 
    schemes and, for comparison, snoopy-cache hardware.  The model 
    is validated against address traces from a bus-based 
    multiprocessor.  The behavior of the coherence schemes under 
    various workloads is compared, and their sensitivity to variations 
    in workload parameters is assessed.  The analysis shows that 
    the performance of software schemes is critically determined 
    by certain parameters of the workload:  the proportion of data 
    accesses, the fraction of shared references, and the number of 
    times a shared block is accessed before it is purged from the 
    cache.  Snoopy caches are more resilient to variations in these 
    parameters.  Thus, when evaluating a software scheme as a design 
    alternative, it is essential to consider the characteristics 
    of the expected workload.  The performance of the two software 
    schemes with a multistage interconnection network is also 
    evaluated, and it is determined that both scale well.
