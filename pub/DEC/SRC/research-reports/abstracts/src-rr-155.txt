As the storage needs of computer applications and users become more
sophisticated and increase beyond what can easily be satisfied by a 
few disk array controllers, aggregating and managing the many disparate 
components of the storage system become severe problems.
Distributed disk systems, which manage collections of disks shared by or
partitioned across multiple nodes, may offer a solution to this 
problem by automating the management of these storage resources.
Such systems can automatically tolerate and recover from component failures,
gracefully scale in capacity and performance as components are added,
allow the storage distributed across multiple nodes to be managed as
a single system, and provide useful management abstractions such as
{\em virtual disks} and {\em snapshots}.

This paper describes the different architectural and design alternatives
embodied in Snappy Disk and Petal, two distributed disk systems that have
similar external features but have radically different internal structures,
and studies the effect of these differences on the systems'
performance, availability, and manageability.
