Authors' Abstract

    Questions of belief are essential in analyzing protocols for 
    authentication in distributed computing systems.  In this paper 
    we  motivate, set out, and exemplify a logic specifically designed 
    for this analysis; we show how various protocols differ subtly 
    with respect to the required initial assumptions of the 
    participants and their final beliefs.  Our formalism has enabled 
    us to isolate and express these differences with a precision 
    that was not previously possible. It has drawn attention to 
    features of protocols of which we and their authors were previously 
    unaware, and allowed us to suggest improvements to the protocols.  
    The reasoning about some protocols has been mechanically verified.

    This paper starts with an informal account of the problem, goes 
    on to explain the formalism to be used, and gives examples of 
    its application to protocols from the literature, both with 
    conventional shared-key cryptography and with public-key 
    cryptography.  Some of the examples are chosen because of their 
    practical importance, while others serve to illustrate subtle 
    points of the logic and to explain how we use it.  We discuss 
    extensions of the logic motivated by actual practice -- for example, 
    in order to account for the use of hash functions in signatures.  
    The final sections contain a formal semantics of the logic and 
    some conclusions.
