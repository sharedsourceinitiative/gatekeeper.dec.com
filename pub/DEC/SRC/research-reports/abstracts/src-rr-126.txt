This report describes the 1993 SRC Algorithm Animation Festival. The
festival continues an experiment in developing algorithm animations by
non-experts, started the previous year, and described in 
SRC Research Report 98. This year nineteen researchers at Digital Equipment
Corporation's Systems Research Center worked for two weeks on
animating algorithms. Most of the participants had little (if any)
experience writing programs that involved graphics. This report
explains why we organized the festival, and describes the logistics of
the festival and the advances in our algorithm animation system. This
report presents the complete code for a simple, but non-trivial,
animation of first-fit binpacking. Finally, this report contains
snapshots from the animations produced during the festival.
