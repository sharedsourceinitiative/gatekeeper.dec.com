This paper describes ANIM3D, a 3D animation library targeted at
visualizing combinatorial structures. In particular, we are interested
in algorithm animation. Constructing a new view for an algorithm
typically takes dozens of design iterations, and can be very
time-consuming. Our library eases the programmer's burden by providing
high-level constructs for performing animations, and by offering an
interpretive environment that eliminates the need for recompilations.
This paper also illustrates ANIM3D's expressiveness by developing
a 3D animation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm in just 70 lines
of code.
