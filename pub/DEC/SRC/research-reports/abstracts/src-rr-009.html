    Sweeping a collection of figures in the Euclidean plane with a
    straight line is one of the novel algorithmic paradigms that have
    emerged in the field of computational geometry. In this paper
    we demonstrate the advantages of sweeping with a topological line
    that is not necessarily straight.  We show how an arrangement
    of  n  lines in the plane can be swept over in O(n^2) time
    and O(n) space by such a line.  In the process each element
    (i.e. vertex, edge, or region) is visited once in a consistent
    ordering.  Our technique makes use of novel data structures which
    exhibit interesting amortized complexity behavior; the result
    is an algorithm that improves upon all its predecessors either
    in the space or the time bounds, as well as being eminently
    practical.  Numerous applications of the technique to problems
    in computational geometry are given -- many through the use of
    duality transforms.  Examples include solving visibility problems,
    detecting degeneracies in configurations, computing the extremal
    shadows of convex polytopes, and others.  Even though our basic
    technique solves a planar problem, its applications include several
    problems in higher dimensions.
