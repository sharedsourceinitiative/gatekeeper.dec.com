Authors' Abstract

    The paper studies the incorporation of a fair nondeterministic
    choice operator into a generalization of Dijkstra's calculus of
    guarded commands.  The new operator is not monotonic for the
    orderings that are generally used for proving the existence of
    least fixpoints for recursive definitions.  To prove the existence
    of a fixpoint it is necessary to consider several orderings at
    once, and to restrict the class of recursive definitions.
