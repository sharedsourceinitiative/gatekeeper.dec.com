"The Vesta Software Configuration
Management System"

Report #177, January 22, 2002. 

Vesta is a system for software configuration management. It stores collections of
source files, keeps track of which versions of which files go together, and automates
the process of building a complete software artifact from its component pieces.
Unlike other software configuration management systems, Vesta was specifically
designed to handle very large projects—tens of millions of lines of code and beyond.
Vesta’s novel approach gives it three important properties not available in
other systems. First, every build is repeatable, because its component sources and
build tools are stored immutably and immortally, and its configuration description
completely describes what components and tools are used and how they are put
together. Second, every build is incremental, because results of previous builds are
cached and reused. Third, every build is consistent, because all build dependencies
are automatically captured, recorded, and checked, so that a cached result from a
previous build is reused only when doing so is certain to be correct. In addition,
Vesta’s flexible language for writing configuration descriptions makes it easy to
describe large software configurations in a modular fashion and to create variant
configurations by customizing build parameters. This report describes the Vesta
technology in detail and discusses the performance of our implementation.
