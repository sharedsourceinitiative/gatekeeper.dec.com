"TLA in Pictures"

September 1, 1994. 20 pages.

Predicate-action diagrams, which are similar to standard
state-transition diagrams, are interpreted as formulas of TLA (the
Temporal Logic of Action).  We explain how these diagrams can be used
to describe aspects of a specification, even when the complete
specification cannot be written as a diagram, and to illustrate
proofs.
