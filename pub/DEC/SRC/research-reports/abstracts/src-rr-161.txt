We develop a logic for reasoning about object-oriented
programs. The logic is for a language with an imperative 
semantics and aliasing, and accounts for self-reference in objects.  
It is much like a type system for objects with subtyping, but 
our specifications go further than types in detailing pre- and 
postconditions.  We intend the logic as an analogue of Hoare 
logic for object-oriented programs. Our main technical result 
is a soundness theorem that relates the logic to a standard 
operational semantics.
