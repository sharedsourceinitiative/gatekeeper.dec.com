The Larch family of specification languages supports a two-tiered definitional
approach to specification.  Each specification has components written in two
languages: one designed for a specific programming language and another
independent of any programming language.  The former are called Larch
interface languages, and the latter the Larch Shared Language
LSL.
<P>
The Larch style of specification emphasizes brevity and clarity rather
than executability.  To make it possible to test specifications without
executing or implementing them, Larch permits specifiers to make claims
about logical properties of specifications and to check these claims
at specification time.  Since these claims are undecidable in the
general case, it is impossible to build a tool that will automatically
certify claims about arbitrary specifications.  However, it is feasible
to build tools that assist specifiers in checking claims as they debug
specifications.  This paper describes the checkability designed into
LSL and discusses two tools that help perform the checking.

This paper is a revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the 
April 1990 IFIP Working Conference on Programming Concepts and Methods.
