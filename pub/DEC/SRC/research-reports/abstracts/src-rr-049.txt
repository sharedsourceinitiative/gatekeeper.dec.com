Author's abstract

    Recent archaeological discoveries on the island of Paxos reveal
    that the parliament functioned despite the peripatetic propensity
    of its part-time legislators.  The legislators maintained consistent
    copies of the parliamentary record, despite their frequent forays
    from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers.  The
    Paxon parliament's protocol provides a new way of implementing the
    state-machine approach to the design of distributed systems---an
    approach that has received limited attention because it leads to
    designs of insufficient complexity.
