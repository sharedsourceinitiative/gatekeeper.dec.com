Computing devices can be specified and studied mathematically. Formal
specification of computing devices has many advantages; it provides
a precise characterization of the computational model, and allows for
mathematical reasoning about models of the computing devices and
programs executed on them.  While there has been a large body of
research on program proving, work has almost exclusively focused on
programs written in high-level programming languages.  Here we address
the important but largely ignored problem of machine-code program
proving.  This work formally describes a substantial subset of the
MC68020, a widely used microprocessor built by Motorola, within the 
mathematical logic of the automated reasoning system Nqthm a.k.a. the
Boyer-Moore Theorem Proving System.  Based on this formal model, we 
mechanized a mathematical theory to automate reasoning about object
code programs.  We then mechanically checked the correctness of MC68020 object 
code programs for binary search, Hoare's Quick Sort, the Berkeley Unix C
string library, and other well-known algorithms.  The object code for
these examples was generated using the Gnu C, the Verdix Ada, and the AKCL 
Common Lisp compilers.
