Computational geometry concepts are often easiest to understand visually, 
in terms of the geometric objects they manipulate.  Indeed, most 
papers in the field rely on diagrams to communicate the intuition 
behind their results. However, static figures are not always adequate. 
<P>
This report has an accompanying videotape, report 133b:
<P>
<H1>The Third Annual Video Review of Computational Geometry</H1>
<HR>
<H2>Edited by Marc H. Brown and John Hershberger</H2>
<i>Time: 54 minutes</i>
<P>
The videotape showcases advances in the use of algorithm 
animation, visualization, and interactive computing in the study 
of computational geometry.  The report contains brief descriptions 
of all the segments of the videotape. 
<P>
Report 133a is the third annual Video Review of Computational Geometry 
to be published as a SRC Research Report. The '92 Video Review is 
SRC Research Report 87, and the '93 Video Review is SRC Research Report 101.
Future editions will be published by the ACM, as part 
of the proceedings of the annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry.
