<H1>Experience with Concurrent Garbage Collectors for Modula-2+</H1>
<HR>

<P>
 Garbage collection is an integral component of Modula-2+, the principal
systems programming language at SRC.  The initial Modula-2+ collector
was a concurrent reference-counting collector; it did not reclaim cyclic
structures, and the cost of assigning references  was
relatively high.
<P>
I implemented three experimental collectors for Modula-2+ and tested
them to explore alternatives to the initial collector: first a
simple concurrent mark-and-sweep collector; then a modified
concurrent mark-and-sweep collector that used VM synchronization
between the mutator and the collector; and then a concurrent
mostly-copying collector that also used VM synchronization.
<P>
These collectors had advantages and disadvantages compared to the
initial Modula-2+ collector.  They reclaimed cyclic structures and
tended to reduce the cost of  assignments, but they
provoked VM thrashing far more readily and sometimes produced noticeable
interruptions of service.  For this reason, we adopted a combined
reference-counting and mark-and-sweep collector for Modula-2+ at SRC,
in which the reference-counting collector reclaims most garbage and
the mark-and-sweep collector executes infrequently to reclaim cyclic
garbage.
