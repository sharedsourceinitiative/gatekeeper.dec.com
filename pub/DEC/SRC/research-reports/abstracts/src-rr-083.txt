Authors' abstract:

We describe a theory of authentication and a system that implements it.
Our theory is based on the notion of principal and a "speaks for"
relation between principals. A simple principal either has a name or is
a communication channel; a compound principal can express an adopted
role or delegation of authority. The theory shows how to reason about a
principal's authority be deducing the other principals that it can
speak for; authenticating a channel is one important application. We
use the theory to explain many existing and proposed mechanisms for
security. In particular, we describe the system we have built. It
passes principals efficiently as arguments or results of remote
procedure calls, and it handles public and shared key encryption, name
lookup in a large name space, groups of principals, loading programs,
delegation, access control, and revocation.
