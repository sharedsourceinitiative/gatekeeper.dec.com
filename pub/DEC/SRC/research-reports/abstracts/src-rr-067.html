  The authentication of users in distributed systems poses special
  problems because users lack the ability to encrypt and decrypt.  The
  same problems arise when users wish to delegate some of their
  authority to nodes, after mutual authentication.
<P>
  In most systems today, the user is forced to trust the node he wants
  to use.  In a more satisfactory design, the user carries a smart-card
  with sufficient computing power to assist him; the card provides
  encryption and decryption capabilities for authentication and
  delegation.
<P>
  Authentication is relatively straightforward with a sufficiently
  powerful smart-card.  However, for practical reasons, protocols that
  place few demands on smart-cards should be considered.  These
  protocols are subtle, as they rely on fairly complex trust relations
  between the principals in the system (users, hosts, services).  In
  this paper, we discuss a range of public-key smart-card protocols,
  and analyze their assumptions and the guarantees they offer.
