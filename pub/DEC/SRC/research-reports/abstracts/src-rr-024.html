    This paper describes a technique for implementing the sort of small
    databases that frequently occur in the design of operating systems
    and distributed systems.  We take advantage of the existence of very
    large virtual memories, and quite large real memories, to make the
    technique feasible.  We maintain the database as a strongly typed
    data structure in virtual memory, record updates incrementally on
    disk in a log, and occasionally make a checkpoint of the entire
    database.  We recover from crashes by restoring the database from
    an old checkpoint, then replaying the log.  We use existing packages
    to convert between strongly typed data objects and their disk
    representations, and to communicate strongly typed data across the
    network (using remote procedure calls).  Our memory is managed entirely
    by a general purpose allocator and garbage collector.  This scheme
    has been used to implement a name server for a distributed system.
    The resulting implementation has the desirable property of being
    simultaneously simple, efficient, and reliable.
