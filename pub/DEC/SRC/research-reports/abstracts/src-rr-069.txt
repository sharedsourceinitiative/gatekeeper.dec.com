"Trestle Tutorial"
Mark S. Manasse and Greg Nelson
May 1, 1992. 70 pages.

This is a tutorial introduction to programming with Trestle, a Modula-3
window system toolkit currently implemented over the X window system. We
assume that you have some experience as a user of window systems, but no
previous experience programming with X or other window systems. To run
Trestle, you need a copy of SRC Modula-3 and an X server. 

The tutorial begins with examples of programming using built-in Trestle
interactors and continues by showing you how to build your own interactors:
both leaf interactors and interactors that contain their own sub-windows and
modify their behavior. 

The source code presented in the tutorial is shipped as part of the Modula-3
release from SRC, in the package "trestletutorial." At SRC, you can fetch a
copy of this by typing 

cp -r /proj/m3/pkg/trestletutorial . 

in your home directory. At other sites, you'll have to ask the people who
installed SRC Modula-3 where they put the package sources. You will
probably want to have a copy of the Trestle Reference Manual (SRC Report
68) nearby as you work through the tutorial. 

The first few examples in the tutorial are programs; their source code is
reproduced in subdirectories named after that program. The later examples are
new classes of interactors. For these, the subdirectories are named after the
interactor, and contain both "src" and "test" subdirectories. The "src"
directories contain the source code for the interface and implementation of the
new interactor, and the "test" directory contains a simple program to exercise
the interactor.
