The paper describes a mechanical checker for software that catches
many common programming errors, in particular array index bounds
errors, nil dereference errors, and synchronization errors in
multi-threaded programs.  The checking is performed at compile-time.
The checker uses an automatic theorem-prover to reason about the
semantics of conditional statements, loops, procedure and method
calls, and exceptions.  The checker has been implemented for
Modula-3.  It has been applied to thousands of lines of code,
including mature systems code as well as fresh untested
code, and it has found a number of errors.
