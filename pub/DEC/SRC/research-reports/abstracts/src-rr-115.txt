A network object is an object whose methods can be
invoked over a network.  This report describes the
design and implementation of a network objects system
for Modula-3.  The system is novel for its overall simplicity.
The report includes a thorough description of realistic marshaling
algorithms for network objects,  precise informal specifications
of the major internal interfaces, preliminary experience, and 
performance results.
