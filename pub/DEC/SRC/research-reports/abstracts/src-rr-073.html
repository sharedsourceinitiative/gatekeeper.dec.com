We consider decidability and expressiveness issues for two first-order 
logics of probability. In one, the probability is on possible worlds, 
while in the other, it is on the domain.  It turns out that in both 
cases it takes very little  to make reasoning about probability highly 
undecidable. We show that when the probability is on the domain, 
if the  language contains only unary predicates then the validity 
problem is decidable. However, if the language contains even one 
binary predicate, the validity problem is $\Pi^2_1$ complete, as 
hard as elementary analysis with free predicate and function symbols. 
With equality in the language, even with  no other symbol, the validity 
problem is at least as hard as that for elementary analysis, 
$\Pi_\infty^1$ hard. Thus, the logic cannot be axiomatized in either 
case. When we put the probability on the set of possible worlds, 
the validity problem is $\Pi^2_1$ complete with as little as one 
unary predicate in the language, even without equality. With equality, 
we get $\Pi_\infty^1$ hardness with only a constant symbol. We then 
turn our attention to an analysis of what causes this  overwhelming 
complexity. For example, we show that if we require rational 
probabilities then we drop from $\Pi^2_1$ to $\Pi_1^1$.  In many 
contexts it suffices to restrict attention to domains of bounded 
size; fortunately, the logics are decidable in this case. Finally, 
we show that, although the two logics capture quite different 
intuitions about probability, there is a precise sense in which they 
are equi-expressive.
