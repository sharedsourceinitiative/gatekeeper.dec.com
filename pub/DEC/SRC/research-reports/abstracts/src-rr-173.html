<H1>High-Performance Web Crawling</H1>

Report #173, September 26, 2001. <p>

High-performance web crawlers are an important component of many web services.
For example, search services use web crawlers to populate their indices,
comparison shopping engines use them to collect product and pricing information
from online vendors, and the Internet Archive uses them to record a history of the
Internet. The design of a high-performance crawler poses many challenges, both
technical and social, primarily due to the large scale of the web. The web crawler
must be able to download pages at a very high rate, yet it must not overwhelm any
particular web server. Moreover, it must maintain data structures far too large to
fit in main memory, yet it must be able to access and update them efficiently. This
chapter describes our experience building and operating such a high-performance
crawler.
