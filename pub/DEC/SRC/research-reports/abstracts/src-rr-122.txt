Obliq is a lexically-scoped untyped interpreted language that
supports distributed object-oriented computation. An Obliq computation
may involve multiple threads of control within an address space,
multiple address spaces on a machine, heterogeneous machines over a
local network, and multiple networks over the Internet. Obliq objects
have state and are local to a site. Obliq computations can roam over the
network, while maintaining network connections.
