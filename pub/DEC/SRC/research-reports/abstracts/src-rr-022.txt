Author's Abstract

    User interfaces based on mice, bitmap displays, and windows are
    becoming commonplace, and there is a growing expectation that
    all programs, no matter how trivial or how complicated, should
    present a graphically elegant and sophisticated user interface.
    Unfortunately, such polished interfaces are normally difficult
    to build. Our goal is to make these tasks much simpler, so that
    application builders and even application users can confront them
    as routine and painless activities.

    The approach described in this report achieves this goal by
    separating the user interface from the application program, as
    is done in many user interface management systems, and by using
    a user interface editor to build the interfaces. In a sense, we
    apply the direct manipulation style characteristic of user
    interfaces to the very process of building them, as opposed to
    building them by programming.
