Lamport recently invented a temporal logic of actions suitable for 
expressing concurrent programs and for reasoning about their 
computations. In this logic, actions have syntactic representations, 
which can be combined and analyzed. The basic construct for relating 
actions and computations is [ ]; a computation satisfies the formula 
[A] if either the computation has halted or the first action in the 
computation is an A action. In addition, the language includes the
temporal operators "always" and "eventually", and thus it is easy 
to write both safety and liveness formulas. 
<P>
However, the temporal logic of actions is not very expressive in some 
respects (just expressive enough). One cannot define the "next" and 
the "until" operators of many previous temporal logics. This is 
actually a feature, in that formulas with "until" are too often 
incomprehensible, and "next" violates the important principle of 
invariance under stuttering. 
<P>
A proof system for the logic of actions might be obtained by translating 
into previous, richer formalisms. In this translation we forfeit the logic 
and its advantages. A new suit of rules for temporal reasoning with actions 
is therefore wanted. A complete axiomatization can provide some guidance in
choosing and understanding the rules used in practice, and in particular 
the laws for reasoning about programs. 
<P>
In this paper, we study a proof system for a propositional logic, PTLA. 
After an informal introduction, we define the syntax and semantics of PTLA
precisely, and then present our proof system and prove its completeness.
