Author's abstract:

This paper describes a high-speed data encryption chip implementing the
Data Encryption Standard (DES). The DES implementation supports
Electronic Code Book mode and Cipher Block Chaining mode. The chip is
based on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) gate array containing 50K
transistors. At a clock frequency of 250 MHz, data can be encrypted or
decrypted at a rate of 1 GBit/second, making this the fastest
single-chip implementation reported to date. High performance and high
density have been achieved by using custom-designed circuits to
implement the core of the DES algorithm. These circuits employ
precharged logic, a methodology novel to the design of GaAs devices. A
pipelined flow-through architecture and an efficient key exchange
mechanism make this chip suitable for low-latency network controllers.
