Author's Abstract

    Consider the functions  H(t):=t^2  and  h(u,v):=uv .  The identity
     H(t)=h(t,t)  shows that  H  is the restriction of  h  to the
     diagonal  u=v  in the  uv-plane.  Yet, in many ways, a bilinear
     function like  h  is simpler than a homogeneous quadratic function
     like  H .  More generally, if  F(t)  is some  n-ic polynomial
     function, it is often helpful to study the polar form of  F ,
     which is the unique symmetric, multiaffine function f(u_1, ...
     ,u_n) satisfying the identity F(t)=f(t, ... ,t) . The mathematical
     theory underlying splines is one area where polar forms can be
     particularly helpful, because two pieces  F  and G  of an  n-ic
     spline meet at  r  with  C^k  parametric continuity if and only
     if their polar forms  f  and  g  agree on all sequences of  n
     arguments that contain at least  n-k  copies of  r.
     
    This polarized approach to the theory of splines emerged in rather
    different guises in three independent research efforts:  Paul
    de Faget de Casteljau called it "shapes through poles";  Carl
    de Boor called it "B-splines without divided differences";  and
    Lyle Ramshaw called it "blossoming."  This report reviews the
    work of de Casteljau, de Boor, and Ramshaw in an attempt to clarify
    the basic principles that underly the polarized approach.  It
    also proposes a consistent system of nomenclature as a possible
    standard.
