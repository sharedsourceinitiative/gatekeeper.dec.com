"DeckScape: An Experimental Web Browser"
Marc H. Brown and Robert A. Shillner
March 1, 1995. 13 pages.

This report describes DeckScape, an experimental World-Wide Web
browser based on a "deck" metaphor. A deck consists of a
collection of Web pages, and multiple decks can exist on the screen at
once. As the user traverses links, new pages appear on top of the
current deck.  Retrievals are done using a background thread, so all
visible pages in any deck are active at all times. Users can move and
copy pages between decks, and decks can be used as a general-purpose
way to organize material, such as hotlists, query results, and
breadth-first expansions.
