  There is a multiplication operation on points that your teachers
  failed to tell you about, either because they didn't know about it
  or because they judged it to be unimportant.  But that
  multiplication turns out to have important applications in
  computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).  Among other things, it
  provides the best labels for Bezier control points --- better even
  than the labels provided by polar forms (a.k.a. blossoms).</p>

  Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space.  Everyone understands
  that it makes sense to multiply covectors, the elements of the dual
  space V* = Lin(V, R).  For example, if x, y, and z are covectors,
  then the expression x&#178;&#160;-&#160;5yz denotes a "quadratic
  form" on the space V.  Forms have lots of applications; for example,
  to put a Euclidean metric on V, we would choose a positive definite
  quadratic form as our measure of squared length.</p>

  But most people don't yet realize that it also makes sense to
  multiply vectors, the elements of V itself.  If u, v, and w are
  vectors, then the expression u&#178;&#160;-&#160;5vw denotes an
  object that is the dual analog of a quadratic form.  Let's call such
  an object a "quadratic site" over V.  The sites over V of all
  degrees form an algebra, dual to the well-known algebra of forms on
  V.</p>

  What are sites good for?  Consider, say, a cubic Bezier curve
  segment.  It is the image, under a cubic function, of a closed
  interval on the parameter line, say the interval [R..S].  The best
  labels for the Bezier points of that cubic segment are the cubic
  sites R&#179;, R&#178;&#160;S, RS&#178;, and S&#179;.</p>
