<H1>Trestle Reference Manual</H1>

<P>
This is a reference manual for Trestle, a Modula-3 toolkit for 
the X window system.  Trestle is a collection of interfaces 
structured around a central abstract type: a ``virtual bitmap 
terminal'' or VBT, which represents a share of the workstation's 
screen, keyboard, and mouse---a thing comparable to the viewers, 
windows, or widgets of other systems.  
<P>
Trestle is included in SRC Modula-3 version 2.0, which is 
available via public ftp.  
<P>
Trestle includes a fairly standard set of interactors, including 
menus, buttons, ``container'' classes that provide overlapping 
or tiled subwindows, and ``leaf'' windows that display text or 
other data.  This reference manual also specifies the interfaces 
that allow you to create your own window classes.  Knowledge 
of X is not required.
<P>
A Trestle window is an object whose behavior is determined by its
methods.  For example, a window's response to a mouse click is 
determined by calling its mouse method. This is fast becoming the 
standard architecture for toolkits, but Trestle carries it further than 
most.  For example, you can change the way a Trestle window paints 
by overriding its paint method; this is useful for sophisticated 
effects like groupware.
<P>
Trestle provides a novel strategy for writing applications that are 
independent of the type of display screen they are running on.  
For example, it is easy to write a Trestle application that can be 
moved back and forth between a color display and a monochrome 
display where the application will look good on both.
