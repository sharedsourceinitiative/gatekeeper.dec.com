<H1>Extensible Records in a Pure Calculus of Subtyping</H1>
<HR>

<P>
Extensible records were introduced by Mitchell Wand while studying
type inference in a polymorphic l-calculus with record types.  This
paper describes a calculus with extensible records, F<:r, that can
be translated into a simpler calculus, F<:, lacking any record
primitives.  Given independent axiomatizations of F<:r and F<: (the
former being an extension of the latter) we show that the translation
preserves typing, subtyping, and equality.
<P>
F<:r can then be used as an expressive calculus of extensible records,
either directly or to give meaning to yet other languages.  We show
that F<:r can express many of the standard benchmark examples that
appear in the literature.
<P>
Like other record calculi that have been proposed, F<:r has a rather
complex set of rules but, unlike those other calculi, its rules are
justified by a translation to a very simple calculus.  We argue that
thinking in terms of translations may help in simplifying and organizing
the various record calculi that have been proposed, as well as in
generating new ones.
