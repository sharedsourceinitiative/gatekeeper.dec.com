"A Practical, Robust Method for Generating Variable Range Tables"
Caroline Tice and Prof. Susan L. Graham
Report #165, September 15, 2000. 16 pages

In optimized programs the location in which the current value of a
single source variable may reside typically varies as the computation
progresses.  A debugger for optimized code needs to know all of the
locations -- both registers and memory addresses -- in which a
variable resides, and which locations are valid for which portions of
the computation.  Determining this information is known as the data
location problem.  Because optimizations frequently move variables
around (between registers and memory or from one register to another)
the compiler must build a table to keep track of this information.
Such a table is known as a variable range table. Once a variable range
table has been constructed, finding a variable's current location
reduces to the simple task of looking up the appropriate entry in the
table.

The difficulty lies in collecting the data for building the table.
Previous methods for collecting this data depend on which
optimizations the compiler performs and how those optimizations are
implemented.  In these methods the code for collecting the variable
location data is distributed throughout the optimizer code, and is
therefore easy to break and hard to fix.  This paper presents a
different approach.  By taking advantage of key instructions, our
approach allows the collection of all of the variable location data in
a single dataflow-analysis pass over the program.  This approach
results in code for collecting the variable location information that
is easier to maintain than previous approaches and that is almost
entirely independent of which optimizations the compiler performs and
of how the optimizations are implemented.
