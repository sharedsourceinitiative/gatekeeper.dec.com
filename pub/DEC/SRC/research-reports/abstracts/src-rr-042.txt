Authors' Abstract

    When implementing parallel programs, it is important to find 
    strategies for controlling parallelism that make the most effective 
    use of available resources. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic 
    strategy called WorkCrews for controlling the use of parallelism 
    on small-scale, tightly-coupled multiprocessors. In the WorkCrew 
    model, tasks are assigned to a finite set of workers. As in other 
    mechanisms for specifying parallelism, each worker can enqueue 
    subtasks for concurrent evaluation by other workers as they become 
    idle. The WorkCrew paradigm has two advantages. First, much of 
    the work associated with task division can be deferred until a 
    new worker actually undertakes the subtask, and avoided altogether 
    if the original worker ends up executing the subtask serially. 
    Second, the ordering of queue requests under WorkCrews favors 
    coarse-grained subtasks, which reduces further the overhead of 
    task decomposition.
