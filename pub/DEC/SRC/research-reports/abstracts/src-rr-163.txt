We present an algorithm, called Disk Paxos, for implementing a
reliable distributed system with a network of processors and disks.
Like the original Paxos algorithm, Disk Paxos maintains consistency in
the presence of arbitrary non-Byzantine faults.  Progress can be
guaranteed as long as a majority of the disks are available, even if
all processors but one have failed.
