    "An Introduction to Programming with Threads."

Author's Abstract

    This paper provides an introduction to writing concurrent programs
    with "threads". A threads facility allows you to write programs
    with multiple simultaneous points of execution, synchronizing
    through shared memory. The paper describes the basic thread and
    synchronization primitives, then for each primitive provides a
    tutorial on how to use it. The tutorial sections provide advice
    on the best ways to use the primitives, give warnings about what
    can go wrong and offer hints about how to avoid these pitfalls.
    The paper is aimed at experienced programmers who want to acquire
    practical expertise in writing concurrent programs.
