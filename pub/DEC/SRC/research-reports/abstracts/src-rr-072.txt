"LM3: A Larch Interface Language for Modula-3:
A Definition and Introduction, Version 1.0"

Author's abstract

This report describes a Larch interface language (LM3) for the Modula-3
programming language. LM3 is a complete example of a Larch interface
language and addresses areas previously ignored in interface language
definition, such as the specification of non-atomic procedures and
object types.

We give a complete definition of the syntax and illustrate it with
some straightforward examples. We also give translation functions
from LM3 specifications to Larch Shared Language traits and show their
use for type checking. Finally, we present example specifications
of standard Modula-3 interfaces.

To remove the possibility of misunderstanding, this report presents 
LM3 using its base syntax and does not use any syntactic sugar. In 
practice, such sugar is convenient and the checker accepts a sugared 
form as well as the raw form presented here.
