A central methodological problem in programming with multiple
levels of abstractions is the loosely defined problem of rep
exposure. This paper traces the problem of rep exposure to the
precisely defined notion of abstract aliasing. The paper
also outlines a statically-enforceable discipline for avoiding
abstract aliasing, but the outline is incomplete.
