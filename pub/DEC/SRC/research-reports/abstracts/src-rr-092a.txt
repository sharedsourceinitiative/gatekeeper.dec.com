Hector is a feasibility study on high-tech corpus lexicography.  Oxford
University Press provided the lexicographers and a corpus of 20
millionwords of running English text; Digital Equipment Corporation
Systems Research Center provided the high-tech tools to enable the
lexicographers to do all of their work on-line.

The tools provide the ability to query the corpus in various ways and
see the resulting matches, to write and edit dictionary entries, and
to link each occurrence of a word in the corpus with its sense as
displayed in the entry editor.  Additional support tools give
statistical information about words in the corpus, derivatives and
related words, syntactic structures, collocates, and case-variants.

This report describes the tools and the status of the project as of
July 1992.
