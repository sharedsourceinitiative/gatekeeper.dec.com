Authors' Abstract

    In computational geometry many search problems and range queries
    can be solved by performing an iterative search for the same key
    in separate ordered lists.  In Part I of this report we show that,
    if these ordered lists can be put in a one-to-one correspondence
    with the nodes of a graph of degree  d  so that the iterative
    search always proceeds along edges of that graph, then we can
    do much better than the obvious sequence of binary searches. Without
    expanding the storage by more than a constant factor, we can build
    a data-structure, called a fractional cascading structure,
    in which all original searches after the first can be carried
    out at only  log d  extra cost per search.  Several results related
    to the dynamization of this structure are also presented. Part
    II gives  numerous applications of this technique to geometric
    problems.  Examples include intersecting a polygonal path with
    a line, slanted range search, orthogonal range search, computing
    locus functions, and others. Some results on the optimality of
    fractional cascading, and certain extensions of the technique
    for retrieving additional information are also included.
