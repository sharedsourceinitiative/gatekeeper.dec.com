<H1>A Practical Approach for Recovery of Evicted Variables</H1>

The residency problem arises in the context of debugging optimized code: a user
may ask to see the value of a variable that is currently in scope, but whose value
has been overwritten (evicted) and is therefore not available. This creates a difficult
situation for the debugger. On the one hand, allowing users to examine the state
of programs as they execute is the raison d’ˆ etre for having debuggers. On the
other hand, the debugger cannot return a value if the value is not in the computer.
Because the residency problem is very common in optimized code, it is critical
that any debugger for optimized code have some mechanism for dealing with it
appropriately.
There are two parts to this problem: detecting that the variable has been evicted
and is no longer resident; and responding appropriately to the user’s request for
its value. Although residency determination has been studied before, recovery of
evicted values apparently has not. In this paper we present Limited Eviction Re-covery,
a simple, practical solution for the residency problem. In this solution the
compiler informs the debugger of those locations in the binary where source vari-ables
are evicted, and the debugger makes copies of the values of the variables
before they are overwritten and lost. In order to avoid incurring too much cost,
the debugger only preserves the values of the variables most likely to be of inter-est
to the user. In addition to explaining our algorithm, this paper describes our
implementation of Limited Eviction Recovery, presents measurements taken of the
resulting system, and discusses some implications thereof.
