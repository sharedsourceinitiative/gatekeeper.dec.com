"Key Instructions:  Solving the Code Location Problem for Optimized Code"
Caroline Tice and Prof. Susan L. Graham
Report #164, August 17, 2000. 25 pages

There are many difficulties to be overcome in the process of designing
and implementing a debugger for optimized code.  One of the first
problems facing the designer of such a debugger is determining how to
accurately map between locations in the source program and locations
in the corresponding optimized binary.  The solution to this problem
is critical for many aspects of debugger design, from setting
breakpoints, to implementing single-stepping, to reporting error
locations.  Previous approaches to debugging optimized code have
presented many different techniques for solving this location mapping
problem (commonly known as the code location problem).  These
techniques are often very complex and sometimes incomplete.

Identifying key instructions allows for a simple yet formal way of
mapping between locations in the source program and the optimized
target program.  In this paper we present the concept of key
instructions.  We give a formal definition of key instructions and
present algorithms for identifying them.  We then show how they
greatly simplify many location mapping tasks, regardless of the
particular approach taken for solving other problems related to
debugging optimized code.  Finally we briefly describe our experiences
implementing and using key instructions.  The concepts presented in
this paper are fundamental rather than complex; but they are of
profound importance in the field of debugging optimized code and are
therefore worthy of careful attention and articulation.
