"New-Value Logging in the Echo Replicated File System"

The Echo replicated file system uses new-value logging. Echo's use of
new-value logging provides a clean separation of the internals of the 
system into one module that is concerned with logging and recovery, and 
another module that is concerned with accessing and updating the file 
system's on-disk structures. The logging module provides a restricted form 
of transaction. The restrictions simplify its implementation but impose
constraints on the file system module. The file system module easily 
satisfies these constraints, resulting in a good match overall.
