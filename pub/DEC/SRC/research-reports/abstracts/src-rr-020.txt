Authors' Abstract

    Formal specifications of operating system interfaces can be a
    useful part of their documentation. We illustrate this by
    documenting the Threads synchronization primitives of the Taos
    operating system. We start with an informal description, present
    a way to formally specify interfaces in concurrent systems, and
    then give a formal specification of the synchronization primitives.
    We briefly discuss both the implementation and what we have learned
    from using the specification for more than a year.  Our main
    conclusion is that programmers untrained in reading formal
    specifications have found this one helpful in getting their work
    done.
