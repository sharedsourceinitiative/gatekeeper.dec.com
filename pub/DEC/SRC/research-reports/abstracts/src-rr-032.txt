Authors' Abstract

     Consider a particle that moves on a connected, undirected graph
      G  with  n  vertices.  At each step the particle goes from the
     current vertex to one of its neighbors, chosen uniformly at random.
     The cover time is the first time when the particle has
     visited all the vertices in the graph starting from a given vertex.

     In this paper, we present upper and lower bounds that relate
     the expected cover time for a graph to the eigenvalues of the
     Markov chain that describes the random walk above. An interesting
     consequence is that regular expander graphs have expected cover
     time  Theta(n ln n).
