    "A Simple Approach to Specifying Concurrent Systems."

Author's Abstract
 
    In the transition axiom method, safety properties of a concurrent
    system can be specified by programs; liveness properties are
    specified by assertions in a simple temporal logic.  The method
    is described with some simple examples, and its logical foundation
    is informally explored through a careful examination of what it
    means to implement a specification.  Language issues and other
    practical details are largely ignored.
