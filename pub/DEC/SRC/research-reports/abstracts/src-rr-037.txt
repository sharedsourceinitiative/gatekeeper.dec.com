Authors' Abstract

    In this paper the authors endeavor to convey the flavor of
    techniques, especially recent ones, that have been found useful
    in designing and analyzing efficient geometric algorithms. Each
    technique is presented by means of a worked out example. The paper
    presupposes some elementary knowledge of algorithmic geometric
    techniques and a more advanced knowledge of classical data
    structures. The aim is to share with the reader some of the
    excitement that permeates one of the most active areas in
    theoretical computer science today, namely the field of
    Computational Geometry. The paper is based on a series of lectures
    delivered at the 1987 NATO Symposium on Theoretical Foundations
    of Computer Graphics and CAD.
