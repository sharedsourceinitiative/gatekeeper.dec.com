"Partial Replication in the Vesta Software Repository"

Report #172, August 17, 2001.

The Vesta repository is a special-purpose replicated file system,
developed as part of the Vesta software configuration management
system.  One of the major goals of Vesta is to make all software
builds reproducible.  To this end, the repository provides an
append-only name space; new names can be inserted, but once a
name exists, its meaning cannot change.  More concretely, all
files and some designated directories are immutable, while the remaining
directories are appendable, allowing new names to be defined but not
allowing existing names to be redefined.

The data stored in a repository can be replicated, to support
distributed software development.  The append-only nature of the
repository greatly simplifies the problem of maintaining consistency
among replicas.  Conceptually, all files and directories stored in all
Vesta repositories are named in one single, global name space.  Each
repository stores some subtree of the complete name space.
Replication is present when the subtrees stored by two different
repositories overlap; that is, some of the same names and data occur
in both.  We call this concept partial replication, because
each repository can choose to replicate all, part, or none of the data
stored in any other repository.

In this paper we outline the main features of the repository,
give a definition for the consistency of partial replicas, describe
how our replication tools maintain consistency, and briefly relate our
experience in using the system for distributed software development
between groups on opposite coasts of the United States.
