This paper gives a self-contained account of a general calculus of 
program semantics, from first principles through the semantics of 
recursion. The calculus is like Dijkstra's guarded commands, but 
without the Law of the Excluded Miracle; like extended dynamic logic, 
but with a different approximation relation; like a relational 
calculus studied by deBakker, but with partial relations as well as 
total relations; like predicative programming, but with a more 
standard notion of total correctness. The treatment of recursion 
uses the fixpoint method from denotational semantics.
