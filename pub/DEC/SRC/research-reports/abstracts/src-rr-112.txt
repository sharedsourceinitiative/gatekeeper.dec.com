The Echo file system project explored several issues in the design and
implementation of distributed file systems. This paper describes the
aspects of the Echo design that are related to providing high
availability. These aspects include the provision of redundant
components (replicated disks and backup servers), the replication of
information, and recovery from failures. Further, we discuss some less
obvious mechanisms needed for providing truly high availability: load
control, dynamic reconfiguration of the system, and the detection and
reporting of faults. Finally, we discuss some of the impact of our
availability mechanisms on application software.
