Abstract

During the last two weeks of July 1992, twenty researchers at Digital
Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center participated in 
the 1st Annual SRC Algorithm Animation Festival. Only two of the 
researchers had previously animated an algorithm, and not too many 
more had ever written an application that involved graphics.  In this 
paper, we report on the Animation Festival, describing why we did it 
and what we did, and commenting on what we learned.
