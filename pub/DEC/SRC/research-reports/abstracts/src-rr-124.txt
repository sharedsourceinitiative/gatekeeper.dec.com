We describe a block-sorting, lossless data compression algorithm, and
our implementation of that algorithm.  We compare the performance of
our implementation with widely available data compressors running on
the same hardware.

The algorithm works by applying a reversible transformation to a
block of input text.  The transformation does not itself compress
the data, but reorders it to make it easy to compress with simple
algorithms such as move-to-front coding.

Our algorithm achieves speed comparable to algorithms based on the
techniques of Lempel and Ziv, but obtains compression close to the best
statistical modelling techniques.  The size of the input block must be
large (a few kilobytes) to achieve good compression.
