"An Old-Fashioned Recipe for Real Time"
Martin Abadi and Leslie Lamport
October 12, 1992.  67 pages


Authors' abstract:

Traditional methods for specifying and reasoning about concurrent
systems work for real-time systems. Using TLA (the temporal logic of
actions), we illustrate how they work with the examples of a queue and
of a mutual-exclusion protocol. In general, two problems must be
addressed: avoiding the real-time programming version of Zeno's
paradox, and coping with circularities when composing real-time
assumption/guarantee specifications. Their solutions rest on properties
of machine closure and realizability.
