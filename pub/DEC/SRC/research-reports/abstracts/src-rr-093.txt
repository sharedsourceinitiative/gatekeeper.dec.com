Larch Proof Assistant"

Author's abstract: 

We sketch a method for deduction-oriented software and system development
The method incorporates formal machine-supported specification and 
verification as activities in software and systems development. We
describe experiences in applying this method. These experiences have
been gained by using the LP, the Larch proof assistant, as a tool for 
a number of small and medium size case studies for the formal development 
of software and systems. LP is used for the verification of the
development steps. These case studies include

	* quicksort
	* the majority vote problem
	* code generation by a compiler and its correctness
	* an interactive queue and its refinement into a network

The developments range over levels of requirement specifications, designs 
and abstract implementations. The main issues are questions of a
development method and how to make good use of a formal tool like LP in
a goal-directed  way within the development. We further discuss of the 
value of advanced specification techniques, most of which are deliberately 
not supported by LP and its notation, and their significance in development.
Furthermore, we discuss issues of enhancement of a support system like
LP and the value and the practicability of using formal techniques such 
as specification and verification in the development process in practice.
