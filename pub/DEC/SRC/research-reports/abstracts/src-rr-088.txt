AN1 (formerly known as Autonet) is a local area network composed of
crossbar switches interconnected by 100Mbit/second, full-duplex links.
In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of certain choices
in the AN1 design.  These include the use of FIFO input buffering in the
crossbar switch, the deadlock-avoidance mechanism, cut-through routing,
back-pressure for flow control, and multi-path routing.  AN1's
performance goals were to provide low latency and high bandwidth in
a lightly loaded network.  In this it is successful.  Under heavy load,
the most serious impediment to good performance is the use of 
FIFO input buffers.  The deadlock-avoidance technique has an adverse
effect on the performance of some topologies, but it seems to be the
best alternative, given the goals and constraints of the AN1 design.
Cut-through switching performs well relative to store-and-forward
switching, even under heavy load.  Back-pressure deals adequately with
congestion in a lightly-loaded network; under moderate load, performance
is acceptable when coupled with end-to-end flow control for bursts.
Multi-path routing successfully exploits redundant paths between hosts
to improve performance in the face of congestion.
