Preface
<P>
    The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
    meeting the needs of modern systems programmers.  Instead of
    exploring new features, we studied the features from the Modula
    family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and
    tried to simplify them and fit them into a harmonious language.
    We found that most of the successful features were aimed at one
    of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more
    systematic type system.
<P>
    Modula-3 descends from Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.  It
    also resembles its cousins Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
<P>
    Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
    provision for explicit interfaces between modules.  It adds objects
    and classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight
    processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.
<P>
    The Modula-3 report was published by Olivetti and Digital in August
    1988.  Implementation efforts followed shortly at both companies.
    In January 1989, the committee revised the language to reflect the
    experiences of these implementation teams.  The main changes were
    the introduction of branded reference types, the requirement that
    opaque types be branded, the legalization of opaque supertypes,
    and the new flexibility in revealing information about an opaque
    type.
