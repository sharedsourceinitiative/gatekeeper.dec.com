Authors' Abstract

    This paper describes a workstation file system that supports a
    group of cooperating programmers by allowing them both to manage
    local naming environments and to share consistent versions of
    collections of software.  The file system has access to the
    workstation's local disk and to remote file servers, and provides
    a hierarchical name space that includes the files on both.  Local
    names can refer to local files or be attached to remote files.
    Remote files, which also may be referred to directly, are immutable
    and cached on the local disk.  The file system is part of the
    Cedar experimental programming environment at Xerox PARC and has
    been in use since late 1983.
