Report #176, December 3, 2001. 
<P>
The memory model of a shared-memory multiprocessor is a contract between
the designer and programmer of the multiprocessor. The sequential consistency
memory model specifies a total order among the memory (read and write) events
performed at each processor. A trace of a memory system satis.es sequential
consistency if there exists a total order of all memory events in the trace that
is both consistent with the total order at each processor and has the property
that every read event to a location returns the value of the last write to that
location.<p>
Descriptions of shared-memory systems are typically parameterized by the
number of processors, the number of memory locations, and the number of data
values. It has been shown that even for .nite parameter values, verifying sequential
consistency on general shared-memory systems is undecidable. We observe
that, in practice, shared-memory systems satisfy the properties of causality and
data independence. Causality is the property that values of read events .ow
from values of write events. Data independence is the property that all traces
can be generated by renaming data values from traces where the written values
are distinct from each other. If a causal and data independent system also has
the property that the logical order of write events to each location is identical to
their temporal order, then sequential consistency can be veri.ed algorithmically.
Speci.cally, we present a model checking algorithm to verify sequential consistency
on such systems for a .nite number of processors and memory locations
and an arbitrary number of data values.
