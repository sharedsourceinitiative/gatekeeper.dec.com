"Some Useful Modula-3 Interfaces"
Jim Horning, Bill Kalsow, Paul McJones, Greg Nelson
December 25, 1993.  103 pages

This manual describes a collection of interfaces defining abstractions
that SRC's programmers have found useful over a number of years of
experience with Modula-3 and its precursors.  We hope the interfaces
will be useful as a "starter kit" of abstractions, and as a model
for designing and specifying abstractions in Modula-3.
