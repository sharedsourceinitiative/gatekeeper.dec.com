Constraints are an important enabling technology for interactive
graphics applications. However, today's constraint-based systems are
plagued by several limitations, and constraints have yet to live up to
their potential.
<P>
Juno-2 is a constraint-based double-view drawing editor that addresses
some of these limitations. Constraints in Juno-2 are declarative, and
they can include non-linear functions and ordered pairs. Moreover, the
Juno-2 solver is not limited to acyclic constraint systems. Juno-2
also includes a powerful extension language that allows users to
define new constraints. The system demonstrates that fast constraint
solving is possible with a highly extensible, fully declarative
constraint language.
<P>
The report describes what it is like to use Juno-2, outlines the
methods that Juno-2 uses to solve constraints, and discusses its
performance.

Computers now handle the words in the documents that we write, and
that is good: Revising, indexing, and formatting are lots easier,
while hyperlinks have opened up shining vistas. Computers also handle
the illustrations in our documents, but the news on that front is not
so good. Producing accurate drawings is still a tedious task in many
cases, revising them later is worse, and animations are not taking off
as fast as hypertext. Even if we grant that a picture is worth a
thousand words to the reader, why is its cost to the writer more like
ten thousand?
<P>
If computers are ever to help illustrators as effectively as they help
authors, some new ideas will be required. Juno-2 is a drawing editor
that explores an intriguing collection of ideas about two-view
editing, constraint-solving, and extension languages. This brief report
gives some early indications of the strengths and weaknesses of those
ideas. (Lyle Ramshaw)
