<H1>The Vesta Language for Configuration Management</H1>
<HR>
<H2>Christine B. Hanna, Roy Levin</H2>

<P>
Current approaches to software configuration management and system
building do not scale up to support large-scale software engineering; 
common practice involves numerous stopgap measures to work around this
shortcoming. The Vesta system is designed to eliminate this problem, by
providing (1) a language designed to support complete, concise
system descriptions and (2) a novel caching mechanism that permits 
efficient system building.
<P>
The Vesta system uses a functional programming language to describe
configurations. This language provides the flexibility and power needed 
to describe large software components. The system descriptions are specific 
and complete, and include all of the sources that are used to build the 
system and all of the instructions that tell how the sources are composed. 
Only information written down in the description can influence construction 
of the system. Nevertheless, the descriptions are concise and easy to read 
and write.
<P>
The language evaluator caches the results of evaluating function
applications, which are the expensive operations in the Vesta language. 
Caching in Vesta is automatic and persistent. Because the language is 
functional and there are no side-effects, caching is conceptually
straightforward. Vesta caches the result of all function
applications--from those at the leaves (e.g., compiling one source
file), to those in the middle (e.g., packaging up a library), all the
way to the top. Caching function applications at all levels permits
Vesta to build and rebuild large software systems efficiently.
