"Authentication in the Taos Operating System"
Edward Wobber, Martin Abadi, Mike Burrows, and Butler Lampson
December 10, 1993.  38 pages.

We describe a design for security in a distributed system and its
implementation. In our design, applications gain access to security
services through a narrow  interface. This interface provides a notion
of identity that includes simple principals, groups, roles, and
delegations. A new operating system component manages principals,
credentials, and secure channels. It checks credentials according to
the formal rules of a logic of authentication. Our implementation is
efficient enough to support a substantial user community.
