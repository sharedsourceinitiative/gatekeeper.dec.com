Over the past few years, we have developed JCAT, a system for building Web-based
collaborative active textbooks on algorithms. JCAT augments the expressive power
of Web pages for publishing passive multimedia information with a full-fledged
interactive algorithm animation system. Views of a running program can reside
on different machines; in an electronic classroom or distance learning setting, a
teacher controls the animation, while students view the animation by pointing their
Web browsers at the appropriate page.

In this report, we integrate our earlier work on using interactive 3D graphics for
algorithm animation into the JCAT system, and we present three new animations.
The JCAT architecture is well-suited for 3D animations because each user can
interact with the 3D views locally, independent of the views on other machines.
The ability to interactively control a 3D scene provides motion cues that are crucial
for resolving ambiguities of 3D scenes displayed on flat screens.
