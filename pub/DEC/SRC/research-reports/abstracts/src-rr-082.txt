Authors' abstract

This guide provides an introduction to LP (the Larch Prover), Release
2.2.  It describes how LP can be used to axiomatize theories in a
subset of multisorted first-order logic and to provide assistance in
proving theorems.  It also contains a tutorial overview of the
equational term-rewriting technology that provides, along with
induction rules and other user-supplied nonequational rules of
inference, part of LP's inference engine.
