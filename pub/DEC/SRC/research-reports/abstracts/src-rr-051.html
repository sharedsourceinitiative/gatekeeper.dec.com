<H1>Experience with the Firefly Multiprocessor Workstation.</H1>

    September 15, 1989.

    Commercial multiprocessors are used successfully for a range of
    applications, including intensive numeric computations,
    time-sharing, and shared servers.  The value of multiprocessing
    in a single-user workstation is not so obvious, especially in an
    environment where numeric problems do not dominate.  The Digital
    Equipment Corporation Systems Research Center has had several years
    of experience using the five-processor Firefly workstation in such
    an environment.  This report is an initial assessment of how much
    is gained from multiprocessing on the Firefly.
<P>
    Reported here are measurements of speedup and utilization for a
    variety of programs.  They illustrate four sources of concurrency:
    between independent tasks, within a server, between client and
    server, and within an application.  The nature of the parallelism
    in each example is explored, as well as the factors, if any, that
    constrain multiprocessing.  The examples cover a wide range of
    multiprocessing, with speedups on a five-processor machine varying
    from slightly over 1 to nearly 6. Most uses derive most of their
    speedup from two or three processors, but there are important
    applications that can effectively use five or more.
