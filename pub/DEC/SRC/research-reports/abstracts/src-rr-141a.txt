Many Web browsers now offer some form of active objects, written in a 
variety of languages, and the number of types of active objects are growing 
daily in interesting and innovative ways. This report describes our work on 
Oblets, active objects that are distributed over multiple machines. Oblets 
are written in Obliq, an object-oriented scripting language for distributed 
computation. The high-level support provided by Oblets makes it easy to write 
collaborative and distributed applications.

A videotape (141b) associated with this work is available.
