<h2>Abstract</h2>

This report describes <em>zippers</em>, an application of
outline-processor technology to the display of Web pages. Zippers
allow users to expand and contract selected sections of a document,
thereby displaying simultaneously the contents of individual sections
of a document as well as its overall structure.  
Zippers can be implemented either directly in a Web browser or by 
a proxy (and consequently used by any off-the-shelf Web browser); 
in either case, no changes to HTML source files are required. <p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

As people rush to put information onto the World Wide Web, more and
more structured documents are appearing. These documents include home
pages with lots of hierarchically organized links, papers with many
sections and subsections, and other lengthy documents such as books
and manuals.<p>

All Web browsers that we know of display each page as a continuous
scroll. Unfortunately, it is easy to lose context when viewing a
snippet of the whole, and it is hard to jump to arbitrary places in
the page. These problems become more severe with longer pages.<p>

Outline processors provide one well known technique for addressing these
problems.  Outline processors allow a user to expand and contract
selected sections and subsections of a document, thus retaining the
high-level structure of the document while also displaying individual
sections. In addition, outline processors allow the user to rapidly
jump within the document.  This report describes the application of
outline processor technology to the display of Web pages.<p>

<h2>Zippers</h2>

Our display of Web pages infers an outline structure from the
heading tags (i.e., H1, H2, ..., H6) in the HTML source. We
mark each heading with an icon called a <em>zipper</em>. Clicking on the
zipper causes the section introduced by the heading to expand and
contract.
Re-expanding a section causes the state of all subsections to reappear
as they were before the section was contracted. However,
shift-clicking on a zipper icon causes the section <em>and all of its
subsections</em> to expand or to contract.<p>

The two sets of screen dumps below shows a Web page using Netscape
(top) and using zippers (bottom).
The zipper display is within the WebCard
browser, an integrated system for handling e-mail messages, bboard
articles, and Web pages <a href="#webcard">[3]</a>.<p>

The screen dumps below show the SRC home page. The page contains a
level-1 heading (a graphic with the letters SRC followed by "Systems
Research Center"), some text, and then four level-2 headings. The
bottom-left screen dump is the default display with zippers: The
single level-1 heading is automatically expanded, thereby causing the
text it contains and any subheaders to be displayed. By default,
subheaders are displayed contracted.  In the bottom-right screen dump,
we've expanded the second and third subheaders.<p>

The screen dumps below show a large document, "A Beginner's Guide to
HTML" by NCSA <a href="#ncsa-html-toc">[1]</a>. (We edited the page to add section
numbers, in order to facilitate the description of zippers.) The
Netscape display is 21 screens of information, scrolled to the spot
just before section "3.1 The Minimal HTML Document." The zipper
displays are scrolled to about the same location. In the bottom-left
screen dump, we've expanded section "3 Creating HTML Documents" of the
default zipper display. The contents of the section are displayed
("HTML documents \dots\ screen display."), and the three subsections
are visible in their contracted form. In the bottom-right screen dump,
we've expanded three more sections: "3.2 Basic Markup Tags," and then
"3.2.2 Headings" (which only became visible after "3.2 Basic Markup
Tags" was expanded), and finally "3.3 Linking to Other Documents."

<h2>Discussion</h2>

Zippers work well on Web pages that use heading tags to indicate the
logical structure of the page. Unfortunately, many authors use heading
tags to produce particular formatting effects, such as font and
pointsize changes, rather than indicate logical structure. On such pages, users
simply turn off the zippers and the page is displayed conventionally.<p>

We know of one Web site that has hand-coded
zippers <a href="#handcoded-zippers">[7]</a>. The drawback of hand coding zippers
is that it requires server interaction to expand or contract, and an
exponential number of files (or a complex script) to generate all
states.<p>

Authors of long pages frequently add a table of contents to the top of
the page, with entries in the table linking to the various
sections. Sometimes, each section appears on its own page, with
"next," "previous," "up," and "top" links on each page.
Unfortunately, it is easy for the viewer to lose the big picture
because the table of contents is not visible while looking at the
contents of a particular section.<p>

An alternative to zippers for retaining the big picture while viewing
the details is a multi-panel display, such as in
SuperBook <a href="#superbook">[2]</a>.  One panel displays the table of contents
and the other panel displays sections in the document. Clicking on an
entry in the table of contents causes the other panel to display the
corresponding part of the document. The user can also open and close
levels of the table of contents, but the body of a section is always
displayed in the second panel. A multi-panel display such as Superbook
could be implemented using Netscape's frames, by adding appropriate
HTML markups and Java code to a source document.<p>

Another related system 
is SoftQuad's Panorama Pro <a href="#panorama">[6]</a>,
which displays SGML documents using a two-panel viewer similar to that
of SuperBook.  Panorama Pro is also loosely integrated with the Web:
The application can be configured as an external viewer of documents
whose MIME type is SGML. Clicking on a URL in a document displayed
by Panorama Pro will cause Netscape (or some other user-specified
browser) to fetch <em>and display</em> the URL. Electronic Book
Technologies' DynaText <a href="#ebt">[4]</a> is another impressive SGML viewer; it
is integrated into Netscape as a plug-in.  It's important to realize,
however, that Panorama Pro and DynaText are not Web browsers.<p>

Our decision to expand an outline view in place was inspired in part
by Pad++ <a href="#pad++">[5]</a>, a zooming graphical interface, and in part by 
the host of successful "context+focus" visualizations developed at
Xerox PARC.<p>

We are currently working on a proxy-based implementation of zippers
that allows zipper-enhanced pages to be displayed in any Web browser.
The idea is simple: A "zipper proxy" runs on the same machine as the
user's browser and sits between the browser and the browser's normal
proxy. The zipper proxy uses the normal proxy for fetching pages, and
modifies the returned HTML to elide material and to include zipper
icons. Each zipper icon is linked to a specially constructed URL that
is intercepted by the zipper proxy and which allows the zipper proxy
to return an appropriate view of the page.<p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Viewing a Web page using zippers has the nice property of allowing one
to see details of parts of the page while maintaining the global
context of the entire page. The larger the Web page -- or the smaller
the vertical space available for the display -- the more benefit there
is to this technique.  Putting this technology into a browser or into
a proxy seems preferable to hand-coding it into each document.<p>
