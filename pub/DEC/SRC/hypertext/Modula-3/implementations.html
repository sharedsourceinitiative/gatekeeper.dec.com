Three implementations are available or under development at this time:

<H2><A NAME=srcm3>SRC Modula-3</A></H2>

SRC Modula-3 was built by the
<A HREF="http://src-www.pa.dec.com/orgs/SRC.html>DEC Systems Research Center</A>.

<P>
The current version, 2.11, implements the language defined in
<A HREF="biblio.html#spwm3">SPwM3</A>.
It is available for a number of
<A HREF="architectures.html">architectures</A>.

<P>
SRC Modula-3 includes a user manual, compiler, runtime library,
some libraries and a few other goodies (see below).

<P>
The compiler generates C as an intermediate language and should be
fairly easy to port.  Except for the very lowest levels of the
thread implementation, the entire system is written in Modula-3.

M3PC is a preliminary port of SRC Modula-3 to
a PC.  Its "official" announcement was made by
Laszlo Boeszoermenyi in <TT>comp.lang.modula3</TT> on March 8:

The Modula-3 system ported by us on the PC and available on the
gatekeeper, runs with MSDOS, gnu c compiler and djgpp memory
manager (detailed description in the read me file).

<P>
You may compile, link and run Modula-3 programs, without threads.
From the library modules only those are tested which are used by
the compiler.  In the course of a student project a
"student-friendly" environment is in development.  It will be
available at end of June (hopefully).

<H2><A NAME=gm3> GNU Modula-3 </A></H2>

GNU Modula-3 is an independent effort to create a Modula-3 system
using the GNU C compiler's backend.
It was announced by Eliot Moss in <TT>comp.lang.modula3</TT> on March 25:

   We said we'd try to get the initial (alpha) release of GNU
   Modula-3 out some time this month (March), and we're in the
   process of figuring out what to release and how to package it
   up. We expect to have something in roughly two weeks (watch
   this space for a notice).

<P>
   What would this be? First, it is a compiler for the VAX (only)
   under Ultrix (only), definitely without threads, and probably
   still failing a small number of the tests in the SRC test
   suite (which implies that not all of libm3 is likely to work
   either). The actual release information will detail more about
   what's working and what's not at that time. We DO currently
   pass all the compiler tests that the SRC compiler did when it
   was first released (i.e., the ones we fail are more obscure
   things that users uncovered over time).

<P>
   Second, the release itself will be a compressed tar file
   including sources and executables. The executables will
   probably work only if you put libraries, etc., in the expected
   places (otherwise, you'll need to rebuild from sources).The
   compiler is written in C and should be compiled with a recent
   version of gcc (so you'll need gcc installed). The system also
   uses gld (the GNU linker).

<P>
   This release should be most useful to people undertaking ports
   to other machines and operating systems, since it will give
   them a head start on understanding the compiler and getting
   the full system ready. It may be of some use for ordinary
   programming, but it really depends on whether you tend to use
   features that tickle the remaining bugs. We are indeed
   interested in alpha test reports, but only if they tell us
   something new (i.e., we'll provide a list of known
   deficiencies).

<P>
   When the release is made, we'll also start email discussions
   with the various parties who have indicated they might
   undertake ports, to help sort out who will do what.

<P>
   Regards, and thanks for your continued interest and
   encouragement -- EM
