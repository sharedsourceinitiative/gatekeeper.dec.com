<P>
This document describes SRC Modula-3.

<P>
There are two licenses for SRC Modula-3.  The
<A HREF="non_commercial.html"> non-commercial licence </A>
is for users that don't intend to build products with SRC Modula-3.
The <A HREF="commercial.html"> commercial licence </A> covers other uses.

<P>
The distribution contains a Modula-3 compiler and runtime, a set of
libraries, a coverage analyzer, a Modula-3 pretty printer, and a small
test suite of Modula-3 programs.  The compiler generates C as
intermediate code.

<P>
This release is known to work on a variety of
<A HREF="architectures.html">architectures</A>.
We have not tested the software in any other configurations.
It may function correctly on other versions of Ultrix or on other machines.

<P>
The compiler and runtime system was designed and implemented by Bill
Kalsow and Eric Muller.  Neither of us view this as a finished
product.  Nonetheless, we thought others might like to use it.  The
system should be of interest to two camps: those interested in trying
out Modula-3 and those interested in compiler hacking. 

<P>
Many <A HREF="contrib.html">contributors</A> helped build SRC
Modula-3.  We would like to thank them all.
