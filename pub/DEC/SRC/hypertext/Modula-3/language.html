<TITLE>The Modula-3 language</TITLE>
<H2> Modula-3 introduction </H2>

<P>
The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
meeting the needs of modern systems programmers.  Instead of
exploring new features, we studied the features of the Modula
family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and
tried to simplify them into a harmonious language.  We found that
most of the successful features were aimed at one of two main
goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more systematic type
system.

<P>
Modula-3 descends from Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.  It
also resembles its cousins Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.

<P>
Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
provision for explicit interfaces between modules.  It adds objects
and classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight
processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.

<P>
The full definition of the language is contained in
<A HREF="http://src-www.pa.dec.com/SRC/SPwM3/book.html">System Programming with Modula-3</A>
also known as SPwM3.  It also describes the standard interfaces,
programming with threads, and the Trestle window system.
