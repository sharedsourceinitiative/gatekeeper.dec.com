Many people contributed to SRC Modula-3, and we would like to thank them.
Below is a partial list of the contributors.<p>

We use the garbage collector developed by Joel Bartlett
(DEC-WRL).  It has been modified to support incremental and
generational collection by John DeTreville (DEC-SRC).<p>

John Dillon (DEC-SRC) provided the original C version of thread
switching.<p>

Mark R. Brown and Greg Nelson (DEC-SRC) designed the 
readers and writers interfaces.<p>

Jorge Stolfi (DEC-SRC) and Stephen Harrison (DEC-WSE)
were very patient alpha-testers. They gave us invaluable bug reports
and also translated some DEC-SRC Modula-2+ modules to Modula-3.<p>

J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Chailloux (ILOG) developed the X interfaces while
visiting DEC-SRC. We also had numerous discussions about the evolution
of SRC Modula-3.<p>

The ``gatekeepers'' (DEC-WRL), in particular Paul Vixie, helped with
the distribution of SRC Modula-3.<p>

David Goldberg (XEROX PARC) ported SRC Modula-3 to the SPARC machines.<p>

Ray Lischner ported the system to the APOLLO machines.<p>

Richard Orgass (IBM Rochester) and Roger Hoover (IBM) 
ported the system to the IBM machines.<p>

Piet van Oostrum (Utrecht University) ported the system to the
HP series 9000/300 computers running HP/UX 7.0.<p>

Pat Lashley (KLA Instruments) contributed the lexer for {\tt pps}.<p>

R&eacute;gis Crelier (ETH) designed and implemented the pickles
modules while he was a summer intern at SRC.<p>

Mick Jordan (DEC-SRC) provided challenging programs to compile.<p>

Norman Ramsey (Princeton University) has pushed the system into
obscure corners and found many bugs there.<p>

R.J. Stroud and Dick Snow (University of Newcastle upon
Tyne) provided the Encore Multimax port.<p>

Dave Nichols (Xerox PARC) fixed and improved the pretty printer.<p>

Greg Nelson and Mark Manasse (DEC-SRC) designed and
implemented the Trestle window system.<p>

Sam Harbison contributed the <code>FieldList</code> interface.<p>

Steven Pemberton (CWI) wrote the <code>enquire</code> program and made
it available to the community.<p>

The <code>vbtkit</code> software has been designed and implemented by
a large number of people at SRC: Andrew Birrell, Ken Brooks, Marc H. Brown,
Mark R. Brown, Pat Chan, Luca Cardelli, John DeTreville, Steve Glassman,
Mark Manasse, Jim Meehan, Greg Nelson, Jorge Stolfi, ary-Claire van Leunen.<p>

<code>FormsVBT</code> is due to Jim Meehan and Marc H. Brown (DEC-SRC).<p>

Peter Klein (RWTH Aachen) contributed a tool to help convert
Modula-2 to Modula-3 programs.<p>

James J. Walker (GTE Laboratories) ported the system to the
HPPA machines.<p>

Thomas Brupbacher (ETH Zuerich) ported the system to the 
SUN386 machines.<p>

Dennis Brueni (<code>brueni@csgrad.cs.vt.edu</code>) ported the system
to the OKI machines.<p>

Dave Detlefs (DEC SRC) wrote the Modula-3 mode for gnuemacs.
David Goldberg (XEROC PARC) wrote the <code>m3tags</code> program.<p>

Thanks also to all the people who used SRC Modula-3 and reported bugs.<p>

The various ports would have been impossible without the work of a
number of people, who kindly made their modifications available.
However, most of the bugs you may find in these ports were introduced
during the final integration of these modifications and we are to be
blamed for them.<p>
