<H1>Modula-3 for Energize</H1>
<P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
This is a modified version of the DEC SRC Modula-3 compiler, which adds the
ability to communicate with the <I>Energize Programming System</I>
from Lucid, Inc.
This enables the Energize browsing tools to be used on Modula-3 code.
 <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>IMPORTANT NOTE</I>
<P>
This is experimental software which is being made available without charge on
an as-is basis.  It is not supported by Lucid, Inc.  There is no warranty of
any kind, so use at your own risk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Pre-requisites</H2>
<P>
This version is for release 3.3 of the Modula-3 compiler and release
3.0 (or later) of Energize, on a Sun SPARCstation running SunOS
release 4.  (It is possible to use it with Energize release 2, but that
doesn't work well enough to be very useful because release 2 doesn't
understand modules.)
<P>
If you don't already have the DEC SRC compiler, either use the World Wide Web
to access: 
<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html">
<TT>http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html</TT> </A> 
(this is also a good source of general information about the Modula-3
language) or get it by FTP:
<P>
<PRE>
    % ftp gatekeeper.dec.com
    Name: anonymous
    Password: <I>&lt;your e-mail address&gt;</I>
    ftp&gt; cd pub/DEC/Modula-3/release-3.3
    ftp&gt; get README
</PRE>
<P>
and then follow the directions there.
<P>

"<TT>info@lucid.com</TT>" or call Lucid sales at 1-800-223-9322.
<P>
<H2>Getting the files</H2>
<P>
The compiler extension for Energize can be obtained by anonymous FTP
 <A HREF="ftp://ftp.lucid.com/pub/hacks/energize/"> from Lucid </A>
 as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    % ftp ftp.lucid.com
    Name: anonymous
    Password: <I>&lt;your e-mail address&gt;</I>
    ftp&gt; cd /pub/hacks/energize
    ftp&gt; binary
    ftp&gt; get modula-3-SPARC-3-3.tar.gz
</PRE>
Or <A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Modula-3/contrib/energize/"> from gatekeeper </A>
 as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    % ftp gatekeeper.dec.com
    Name: anonymous
    Password: <I>&lt;your e-mail address&gt;</I>
    ftp&gt; cd /pub/DEC/Modula-3/contrib/energize
    ftp&gt; binary
    ftp&gt; get modula-3-SPARC-3-3.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to be able to build the extended compiler from source, then
pick up the file <TT>modula-3-source-kit.tar.gz</TT>.  This includes the
connection libraries for building for either SunOS or Solaris.
<P>
<H2>Installation and use</H2>
<P>
Assuming that you have already installed the standard releases of both the SRC
compiler and Energize, the following additional files are provided in this
package, to be added to the installation directory of the Modula-3 compiler:
 <DL>
 <DT> <TT>m3c-ez </TT>
 <DD> An alternate version of "<TT>m3c</TT>", the compiler front-end.
 <DT> <TT>m3-ez</TT> 
 <DD> This is a script which is used like "<TT>m3</TT>" (the
compiler driver) except that it uses "<TT>m3c-ez</TT>" instead of
"<TT>m3c</TT>" and if the optional argument "<TT>-Xez</TT>" is supplied,
the compiler will connect to Energize.
 <DT> <TT>m3build-ez</TT> 
 <DD> This script is like "<TT>m3build</TT>" except that it
uses "<TT>m3-ez</TT>" instead of "<TT>m3</TT>", passing the "<TT>-Xez</TT>"
argument if supplied, and it uses the Energize incremental linker instead
of "<TT>ld</TT>".  It also uses "<TT>energize_make_target</TT>" to record a
build command for the target program.
 </DL>
Once these are copied into your installation directory, you will need to edit
the pathnames in the two script files to match the location of your
installation.
<P>
Also, you will want to be sure to take advantage of the Emacs mode support for
Modula-3.  Your "<TT>.emacs</TT>" file should contain something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
  (autoload 'modula-3-mode "/usr/local/modula3/lib/elisp/modula3" nil t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '("\\.[im][3g]$" . modula-3-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (setq completion-ignored-extensions
        (append completion-ignored-extensions
	        '( ".mo" ".mx" ".mc" ".io" ".ix" ; Modula-3 internal files
		)))
</PRE>
<P>
The file "<TT>modula3.el</TT>" is included in the SRC distribution as part
of file "<TT>tools.tar.gz</TT>".  Alternatively, there is a slightly older
version in the Energize 3.0 directory as
"<TT>$ENERGIZE_ROOTDIR/etc/unsupported/elisp/nm3.elc</TT>".
<P>
Thus, where you would normally do a build by:
<PRE>
    m3build
</PRE>
if you instead do:
<PRE>
    m3build-ez -Xez
</PRE>
then the compiler and linker will connect to Energize and report information
to it.
<P>
<H2>Limitations</H2>
<P>
This implementation is far from being complete, but it does provide for using
most of the capabilities of the Energize browsers with Modula-3 code: Language
Element Browser, call graphs, object inheritance graphs, error messages
annotated in the source code, edit definition or declaration, visit uses of
language element, etc.  The major features that are not supported are
"incremental compilation" and "smart compilation".  You do, however, get
incremental linking, which can save a lot of time.  Another obvious limitation
of the current Energize release is that the browsers tend to display
everything using C++ syntax and terminology.
<P>
Some additional details of the limitations of the current implementation:
  <UL>
<LI> Since the current version of the SRC compiler only supports building
programs or libraries, rather than compiling individual files, the Energize
"<B>Compile File</B>" command doesn't work on Modula-3 files.  Because of
this, the executable target is given the build option "do not build
sub-targets".
<LI> When "<TT>m3build-ez</TT>" is used, a use of `<TT>m3_option</TT>' in the
"<TT>m3makefile</TT>" gets an error.  I just haven't figured out the right
way to override the options in the "<TT>m3build</TT>" line (assuming that
there is one).
<LI> The compiler tells Energize that it is generating object files named
"<I>foo</I><TT>.mo</TT>", although the default SPARC configuration for this
release is to use "<I>foo</I><TT>_m.o</TT>"
<LI> In many cases the browsers just show a language element's name without
qualifying it with the module name.
<LI> The browsers don't distinguish between a <TT>RECORD</TT> and an
<TT>OBJECT</TT>; both are called a "class".
<LI> The values of constants are not reported.
<LI> Enumeration element names are not reported.
<LI> Energize doesn't understand set types and subrange types.
<LI> Inherited members of objects are not reported to Energize, so are not
available in the class grapher.
<LI> The Language Element Browser for a method doesn't show the overriding or
overridden methods from other objects.
<LI> Exceptions and generic modules are not properly handled.
<LI> The compiler shouldn't be writing error messages to `<TT>stdout'</TT> when
it is invoked by Energize.
<LI> <B>Edit Definition</B> doesn't find variables belonging to other modules
unless the module is explicitly specified.
<LI> Qualified names (i.e.  module.member) are not supported by lookup from a
browser panel.  (They are however understood by <B>Edit Definition</B>,
<B>Edit Declaration</B>, and <B>Browse Selected Element</B>.)
<LI> Interface files edited during a build may not be detected as needing to be
saved.
<LI> The <TT>READONLY</TT> argument attribute is not shown in the browsers.
<LI> Visit uses of language element sometimes claims to not be able to find a
textual reference to the name within the procedure; there seems to be
something wrong with its understanding of the Modula-3 lexical rules.
<LI> There are a number of bugs relating to proper scoping of names defined in
unusual ways involving aliasing or "<TT>FROM</TT> ...  <TT>IMPORT</TT> ..."
or "<TT>REVEAL</TT> ...  <TT>=</TT> ...  <TT>REF</TT> ...";
<LI> There is some confusion if a module has more than one "<TT>FROM</TT> ...
<TT>IMPORT</TT> ...".
<LI> Energize sometimes gives an invalid consistency warning for two type names
that ought to be equivalent.  You may want to start Energize with the
"<TT>-noinconsistencies</TT>" option to avoid this.
<LI> After editing a Modula-3 function to remove some code and recompiling, the
removed reference may still appear in the Language Element Browser.
<LI> When connected to Energize, the compiler may give invalid errors on a
forward referenced name used by a formal argument.
<LI> The Energize Debugger has some trouble resolving names of Modula-3 source
files when connected to Energize; it works OK using "<TT>gdb</TT>" not
connected to Energize.  [ref 19904]
<LI> Open array types are not reported to Energize.
<LI> The return type of object methods is incorrectly shown as being the
containing object.
</UL>
<P>
There are probably many other bugs that have not yet been discovered.  The
modified compiler has been successfully used in its own development, but has
had negligible testing beyond that.
<P>
If you find additional bugs, I would be interested in hearing about them, but
any bug fixing will be strictly on the basis of "if and when I feel like it".
Once again, this is not a supported product of Lucid, so the Lucid customer
support folks won't be able to help you with this.  If you would like to
volunteer to help with fixing or extending the implementation, that would be
most welcome.  The modified compiler sources are available on request.
