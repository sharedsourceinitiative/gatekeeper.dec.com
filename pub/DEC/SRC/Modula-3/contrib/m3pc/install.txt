HOW TO INSTALL M3PC-Klagenfurt
------------------------------


(1) The files you need:

    (a) mandatory:
            readme     (you should read it)
            tar.exe    (to untar the tar files on your computer)
            djgpp.exe  (the gnu-C compiler - used by the Modula-3 compiler)
            m3.tar     (binaries and libraries of the Modula-3 compiler)

    (b) optional:
            m3src.tar   (sources of the Modula-3 "compiler",
                         the Modula-3 linker ("driver") and
                         the Modula-3 standard library "libm3")
            install.txt (this file)


(2) Move "tar.exe" somewhere into one of your path directories.


(3) If you do not have directory "\tmp", create it. It is used
    by the C-compiler. Type
     c> md \tmp


(4) Install the gnu-C compiler on your PC:
     c> cd \
     c> tar xvf djgpp.tar
    It  is necessary  to change  to  the  root directory  (with  the  first
    command).  The second command will extract the C-compiler  from the tar
    file into the directory "\djgpp". You may now delete the file djgpp.tar
    - it saves diskspace. The C compiler requires about 6.7 MB disk space.


(5) Install the Modula-3 binaries:
     c> cd \
     c> tar xvf m3.tar
    Again you have to be in the root-directory.  The Modula-3 binaries will
    be extracted  into the directory "\m3".  After the extraction  you will
    have the following files in the directory "\m3\bin":

           m3.exe             the compiler-driver
           m3compil.exe       the m3-compiler
           m3shell.exe        the Modula-3-PC shell
           emake.exe          make command whithout shell

    The  interface files (*.i3)  are in  "\m3\include",  the  libraries  in
    "\m3\lib"  and the  document files  are kept in "\m3\doc". The complete
    Modula-3 compiler (without sources) needs about 6.6 MB of disk space.


(6) Configure your PC:
    Take a look at the files "\m3\config.m3"  and  "\m3\m3rc.bat".  You can
    use "config.m3" instead of your config.sys. If this is not possible, be
    sure to change your file  to match the declarations in it.  You have to
    start "m3rc.bat" before you can use the m3-compiler. The best thing is,
    to add the line "\m3\m3rc.bat" at the end of your autoexec.bat. Be sure
    to change the line that sets up smartdrive (the DOS diskcache).  If you
    don't give smartdrive several megabytes,  the compilations will be very
    slow.  So leave about 2-3 MB  of your available main memory for running
    your  programs  and  give  the  rest  to  smartdrive  (up to 10 MB  for
    smartdrive will still speed up compilations, but 6 MB is reasonable).

    CAUTION:
    use  CTRL-SYSINTR  (often called CTRL-BREAK, too) instead of CTRL-C  to
    interrupt programs or the Modula-3 compiler, respectively.  Make copies
    of the file  \m3\lib\filename.map  frequently.  This is the translation
    table to map filenames between long UNIX style names and DOS filenames.
    If your system hangs because of wrong configuration or sometimes if you
    press  CTRL-C,  this file may become corrupted.  Once the file is lost,
    you will not be able to start any Modula-3 program (including the shell
    and  the  compiler ).    There  are  three  backup  copies  within  the
    distribution:

             \m3\lib\filename.max
             \m3\lib\filename.min
             \m3\lib\filename.bak

    The latter is identical with "m3\lib\filename.map".  But as soon as you
    change the file  (by using  your own  long filenames)  you have to make
    your own backups.

    If you plan  to recompile the system,  it may be wise  to switch to the
    longer version BEFORE making  any  changes  to  the  translation  table
    (see 9).


(7) Print out the manualpages for the m3-shell (you will find a LaTeX and a
    PostScript  version  in  "\m3\doc").  Take a look  at the interfaces in
    "\m3\local\include" ,   the  interfaces  there   are   implemented   in
    "libm3loc.a" and might be interesting for you.


(8) Reboot your PC and enjoy using the Modula-3 PC compiler!   You can test
    the Modula-3 compiler by typing:

            c> m3shell
            m3> cd /m3/test
            m3> make hello
                m3 -why ... and other parameters
                program missing -> link hello
                converting hello to hello.exe
            m3> hello
                Hello M3-PC world !
            m3> exit
            c>


(9) Optional:
    If you want  the source-files  of  your  system,  change  to  the  root
    directory  and  extract "m3src.tar".  For all sources  of the compiler,
    driver  and  the standard library  you need  about 5.9 MB  of free disk
    space. There are batch-files "m3make.bat"  in each  "dos386"  directory
    which you can use to recompile your system. Before you can do this, you
    have to instruct your system about a lot of new long filenames.  In the
    m3shell type:

           m3> cd /m3/lib
           m3> copy filename.bak filename.map
           m3> exit

    Then restart the shell by typing "m3shell" and go on recompiling.
