Subject: AFR31 on DEC OSF/1 3.0?
Date: Fri, 16 Sep 1994 10:57:31 -0700
From: Arul Ananthanarayanan <arul@cse.ucsc.edu>


Has anyone ported AF3R1 to DEC OSF/1 version 3.0? I have
been having trouble compiling Aaxp. It seems that 
the header /usr/sys/include/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.h 
has changed from OSF/1 version 2.0.


The BBA_open structure in /usr/sys/include/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.h
has more fields now, and it uses a macro "NUM_TX_BUFS" that doesn't
appear to be defined anywhere in the include tree.


Thanks,

Arul

Yes.

A change in /usr/sys/include/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.h
is breaking the Aaxp build.  This amd79c30.h is referencing a macro
NUM_TX_BUFS bufs that it doesn't define.  I poked around in the kernel
code and found where it is defined.  The source file
./kernel/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.c defines NUM_TX_BUFS to be 2 before it
includes amd79c30.h.  So, I added this define to the three files in
./AF/server/dda/axp that include amd79c30.h.  Diffs are included
below.  

I filed a problem report and the problem will hopefully be fixed in the next
V3.? release.

  [First a brief note: A gentle reminder to af readers to use 
  af-request@crl.dec.com for requesting mailing list changes. Thanks.]

Thanks for the bug report.
  
  Has anyone ported AF3R1 to DEC OSF/1 version 3.0? I have
  been having trouble compiling Aaxp. It seems that 
  the header /usr/sys/include/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.h 
  has changed from OSF/1 version 2.0.
  
You are correct, indeed. I have incorporated a fix for this problem that 
was recently supplied to me. This fix and some others are included in a 
collection of small patches bringing AF3R1 to patch level 9.

All patches (and a source kit at patch level 9) are in this FTP area:

	crl.dec.com:/pub/DEC/AF/

or, if you prefer to get there via a WWW browser,

	ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/DEC/AF

Regards,
 Tom Levergood

PS

Hi Diane,
     We have the same system and have AFR1 running well. We just got the 
binaries down of dec and stuck them on the machine, its a lot easier and 
cleaner.
     As far as I know the instalation of AF tells you that if you are running 
OSF/1 V1.3 or up then the drivers are built-in. To be sure of this try to read 
all of the readme files with AF. I know it is time consuming as there is one in 
each sub directory but its worth while. Again  the binaries are easier.

regards,
turlough

Does anyone know how to unsubscribe from this list?  I sent an

other "unsubscribe af" messages, but the mailing list apparently isn't
of the Majordomo ilk.

Any help appreciated!

I believe the usual LISTSERV usage is to send the mail NOT to
af@crl.dec.com but to af-request@crl.dec.com.

Subject: Standard AudioFile format.....


I was wondering if anyone could send me a short summary of the AudioFile
default sound file format.  (I believe it's called mu-law)

I searched around through the AF include files, and AConvertCTxt (the type
that I think I want)  is defined as void,[D[D[D[D[D[typedef'd as void, to remain opaque, and I don't have
the source so I couldn't find a use of AConvertCTxt in the libs....

All I need is a way to figure out what each byte means (i.e., header format,
byte sequence, type definitions of any C objects fwritten into the file, etc.)

Incidentally, this might be good info for the FAQ.  (Yes, I read it, sorry if
I missed this info)

Thanx in advance..

Brent Spillner

I don't know the AF FAQ, but the info you're looking for is in the
Audio File Formats FAQ.  Ftp'able from ftp.cwi.nl in pub/audio (read
the INDEX file).  Maybe the AF FAQ should have a pointer to the Audio
File Formats FAQ?  BTW I suspect a .ul file is headerless U-LAW.

Subject: Ftp site for "Ak" ?

"Ak" is an audio extension for Tcl. It is built on top of AudioFile. I am
trying to locate the ftp site where I can find this extension.

Can someone familiar with "Ak" please let me know where I can get the source
and binary for "Ak". (I posted a message on Tcl newsgroup but have not 
received any response about it). Thanks a lot.

Hi
We want to buy a J300 card for a AXP 3000/500, OSF/1, Version 2.1. 
As I saw through the last mails about J300, it seems
you need drivers from the MME kit  to run AF Applications on the J300.
Isn't the J300 driver available through AF3R1 ? 
Do I have to order the Mulitmedia Services for OSF/1 
	a) Development Kit or 
	b)  Run-Time Kit 
to run the well known AF clients ?
Thanks

Hi,

I am WonIl Lee in C.S. department of POSTECH in Korea.

My lab is mainly developing spoken Korean analysis techniques and

applications.

We have two versions of systems in Sparc + ProPort656 and Sparc10.

I read that you can manage ProPort656 in AF.

Is it possible in Sparc too?

Is it possible to connect telephone to Sparc + ProPort656  or 

Sparc10 without other interface?

Thanks.

Hi, I'm using the audiofile Aaxp server with a standard telephone handset.

I figgured it out, I needed to just boost the input volume.

Do I need to do anything special to get Mosiac audio annotations to work?

For example, when I do annotate, then COMMIT:  I get;

mv: rename /tmp/saaaahpza to /usr/users/snyder/.mosaic-personal-annotations/PAN-
5.au: No such file or directory

Which suggests the file isn't being recorded into the right place.

All,

We have been successfully using AF in an operations environment for
almost one year now and are generally very happy with it.  We are
using 2.2 and since we were having no problems with it we have not
upgraded.  Recently, one of the AF servers running on a Sparc under
SunOS has permanently hung.  Any clients trying to connect to it also
hang.  Has anyone else seen such problems?

Details of the environment:
  /usr/bin/uname -a:                 SunOS pthinm1 4.1.2 1 sun4c
  /usr/bin/mach:                     sparc
  /usr/bin/arch:                     sun4
  AF Version:                        2.2
  patchlevel.h:                      "#define PATCHLEVEL      28"

strace of AF:
  % strace -p 436
  Process 436 attached - interrupt to quit
  write(4, "\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff
  \ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff\ff".., 232
Nothing happens to this when a client tries to connect to AF or if you
try to open /dev/audio.

last line of strace of a client
  % strace aset -server pthinm1.pth:0 q
  ...
  connect(4, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(7000), sin_addr=inet_addr("13
  4.159.190.162")}, 16

The same problem happened simultaneously on two identical machines.  I
killed and restarted AF on one machine and have had no problems with
it since.  I have kept the other one alive so I can try to find out
what went wrong with it.  Both machines are 3000 miles away from me
and we have been playing around with NFS and auto mounting recently. 
Could that have caused the OS to be unable to complete the write?

Anyone got any ideas? 

Greg

The bba device on the 300X drives both an internal speaker and the
modular jack.  Is there any way to instruct the Aaxp server to only
play through one of these? (ie turn off the internal speaker and
listen just using headphones?).  I've tried various aset incantations
to no avail.

Has anyone ported AF to the HPUX ?  (Please email, as im not (yet) on the

Nope, but then I'm a newbie to NAS.  I am interested in those target OSes.
I believe HPUX is finally SVR4.  I'm not sure what AIX is, but I would 
imagine that they are SVR4 too.

Subject: aconvert on sun

When I compile aconvert on a sun and do

aconvert -b $f,f=raw,t=linear,r=16.0 -,f=raw,t=linear,r=8.0

The output is noisy -- not byteswapped or anything.  It sounds like
static on the radio.

The same program compiled on an Alpha is fine.  I need a Sun
executable.  Has anyone fixed this?

I just finished a port of AF3.1 to the HPUX "Advanced Digital Audio Interface"
hardware that is installed in my HP735.  It appears to work, no gurantee's of
course.  No recording support has been built, in fact most of it was
commented/defined out, as I didnt need it to play Xpilot sounds ;).  You can
fetch the distribution from anonymous ftp at cxc1.msu.edu in pub/

Is there any code in the AF source that would allow the promotion of sampling
rate's on the fly?  That is, I'd like to be able to run the Ahpux server at a
constant 48000khz to my audio hardware, but have the server correctly play 8khz
files by bumping the rates.

Hello.

  Is there any code in the AF source that would allow the promotion of 
  sampling rate's on the fly?  That is, I'd like to be able to run the 
  Ahpux server at a constant 48000khz to my audio hardware, but have the 
  server correctly play 8k hz files by bumping the rates.
  
The server does not support sampling rate conversion in AF3. I know how the 
design should evolve to support on-the-fly conversion, but the changes 
include protocol changes and will most likely be done as part of the 
"CommonAudio" effort.

As an aside, there is a general conversion library in the contrib tree 
within AF3.  It supports datatype and sampling rate conversion. There are 
cases where server-side resampling is necessary, but from your message, it 
seems like you only need to resample on the client-side. It should be 
straightforward to add sampling rate conversion calls (aconvert lib) to the 
aplay client (and arecord).

 Tom Levergood

Hello.

In preparation for the contributed HP port, I generated patch 10 to AF3R1. 
There is one substantial component to this patch that resolves an 
occasional problem with the Amsb server.  Otherwise, the remainder of this 
patch fixes many small nits.

     10a     re-fix some bzero casts, broken by contributed patch.
     10b     cosmetic fix to #define in most server/dda directories.
     10c     Amsb server, occasional gargling sound resolved.
     10d     Remove Als from server/Imakefile.
     10e     AFUtils variable name change for g++.
     10f     arecord client, fix sscanf of gain switch value.
     10g     docs.
     10h     Update patchlevel.h

By anonymous FTP from crl.dec.com:/pub/DEC/AF/AF3R1.tar.Z you can retrieve 
the source kit at patch level 10. The complete set of patches is in 
AF3R1-patches.tar.Z in that same directory.  

Or if you prefer,
	ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/DEC/AF/

The HP port contributed by Charles Henrich should appear as patch 11.

    I believe these two errors to be uncorrelated... but, instead of writing 
    two help messages... I just wrote one...

    I noticed (in af-mail-archive) that sgutfreund@gte.com had the same error,
    but I do not know how he managed to solve this problem... 

    Finally, if the function memmove() should be on my system, in what 
    file should it be?...

    	    Thank you for your help....

   I also am using SunOS 4.1.3, and it worked fine for me.  How are you
   untar'ing it?  The relative packing using "./AF" is the preferred
   method as many other systems have trouble if you do not.  Simply
   cd'ing to the directory head where you want to unpack the tree
   and entering "tar xvf AF3R1.tar" should do the trick.

I had trouble untaring the AF-3.1 distribution in SunOS 4.1.3.  It
seemed that the Sun tar created a *file* called ./AF instead of a
directory.  GNU's tar seemed to work fine.  Is there some incompatibility
between DEC's tar and Sun's tar?

Hi,

I am a new AF user and I would be really grateful if anyone could help me with
a couple of questions.

I am using AF on a DEC Alpha 3000 Axp with no extra audio hardware.

What kind of hardware do I need to connect to a British phone socket ?

and

Assuming I can do the above - is there and easy way to read in, and distinguish
between DTMF tones ?

Thanks in advance,

Bruce.

Subject: questions on LoFi with AF
To: af
Date: Mon, 14 Nov 94 14:15:52 EST

Greetings,

	I am a new user of AudioFile at MIT's Media Lab. 
I am using an alpha 3000/400 equiped with a LoFi device.
and I have two questions:

	1) If I have two mono-CD quality sound files and I need
to have a linear combination of those two to be projected
from the right and left speakers (different linear combinations
for the two speakers), how do I set AF up to do that. I understand
how to change the gain on a stereo-CD file, but I have not figured
out how to separate the right from the left channel? can anyone help
please, I have read through the documentations, but cannot
find the answer!

	2) along with that I need to program the 56k chip
that is on the LoFi. I hope to do reverberation using this chip.
How does one go about doing this, or where can I find documentation
to achieve this?

	I am greatly thankful for all your help,

		yours truly

Hello.
  
  	I am a new user of AudioFile at MIT's Media Lab. 
  I am using an alpha 3000/400 equiped with a LoFi device.
  and I have two questions:
  
  	1) If I have two mono-CD quality sound files and I need

  from the right and left speakers (different linear combinations
  for the two speakers), how do I set AF up to do that. 

You can play each mono source to one of the mono output devices using 
independent gain values for each source.  The server will mix the sources 
for you.  Alternatively, you can mix the mono sources in the client 
application.  The AC (Audio Contexts) can be used to set a client-specific 
output gain.

  I understand how to change the gain on a stereo-CD file, but I have not 
  figured out how to separate the right from the left channel? can anyone 
  help please, I have read through the documentations, but cannot find the 
  answer!
  
AF delivers alternating L/R samples when recording from a 2 channel device, 
and expects alternating samples for playback to a 2 channel device.

  	2) along with that I need to program the 56k chip
  that is on the LoFi. I hope to do reverberation using this chip.
  How does one go about doing this, or where can I find documentation
  to achieve this?
  
I will send you mail about this.

Hello.

Recently, Charles Henrich <henrich@crh.cl.msu.edu> contributed the source 
code for his AF3R1 port to HPUX.  I have created a patch that installs his 
changes into an AF3R1 source tree at patch level 10.

The patch is located in the file AF3R1-patches.tar.Z at
	crl.dec.com:/pub/DEC/AF/ 

Or if you prefer, here is the URL.
	ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/DEC/AF/AF3R1-patches.tar.Z

From this kit, install the files patches/patch.11[a-f]. I will wait to 
update the source kit (AF3R1.tar.Z) until I hear that someone successfully 
installed and tested this patch on an HP (Charles' original message said he 
tested it on HP735 with the HPUX "Advanced Digital Audio Interface" 
hardware.)

Subject: LoFi DEC part number

DEC (UK) and their Alpha distributors (FrontLine) can't find any
reference to decAudio or Lofi (although they're keen to sell the
audio-visual J300).  Can anyone help with a part number/UK contact ?

As an aside, are there any simpler add-on devices that would provide 
DTMF detect and signal? Could a modem be adapted?

Subject: Manpages for release

Hi,

Having installed AF Rel 3.1, there seems to be a discrepancy between then man
pages and the actual functions, specifically AFTonePair()

The man page looks something like this :

extern void AFTonePair(double f1, double dBgain1, double f2, double dBgain2,
                       int gainramp, unsigned char *buffer, int length);

...etc...etc....

But after trying to use it and getting errors, I had a look at AFUtils.h and 
found this.....

extern int AFTonePair(double f1, double dBgain1, double f2, double dBgain2,
		      double sampleRate, AFEncodeType encodeType,
		      int gainramp, AF_CARD8 *buffer, int length);

It seems that the man pages that came in the same tar file as the include file
are not referring to the same release.

Does anyone have more up to date man pages to give me some kind of idea of how
to use this newer version of AFTonePair? 

Cheers,

Bruce.

Hello.

  Having installed AF Rel 3.1, there seems to be a discrepancy between then man
  pages and the actual functions, specifically AFTonePair()
  
Thanks for noticing this.  Hopefully that is the only case :-).  Let me 
know if you find others.

  extern int AFTonePair(double f1, double dBgain1, double f2, double dBgain2,
  		      double sampleRate, AFEncodeType encodeType,
  		      int gainramp, AF_CARD8 *buffer, int length);
  
  Does anyone have more up to date man pages to give me some kind of idea 
 of how to use this newer version of AFTonePair?

A more up-to-date man page does not yet exist --- I will update the man page.  

Meanwhile, you can find one example that uses this procedure in the AF3R1 
source kit (see AF/lib/AF/DialPhone.c).  This example uses AFTonePair to 
generate a DTMF dialing sequence.

The man page description is mostly correct. What has changed in the AF3R1 
release is that the AFTonePair procedure is slightly more general and can 
output other datatypes than mu-law, and can synthesize the tone-pair using 
arbitrary sampling rates.  For explanations of f, dbgain, and gainramp see 
the man page.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
 Tom Levergood

Subject:  Matlab talks to AF. :-)

    I thought people working with Matlab would like this kit... 
    I know I do..

        Have a good one...

----
            Matlab now talks to AF.... :-)
 
About the kit: 
 
        - you can get this kit by anonymous ftp at:
            
            gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu:/pub.local/hans/AFsoundMex.tar.Z
 
 
        - The files in the kit, are:
  
        AFsoundMex.m, AFsoundMex.c, sound.m and this README
        file.
 
 
        AFsoundMex.m and AFsoundMex.c are the M and Mex
        files to be used... (To compile a Mex file, look
        at the Matlab documentation...)
  
        sound.m is the modified Matlab sound.m file that I

        - The License on this module is the same as the one used by the
        X Consortium and AF3R1 (i.e. it places the module in the public 
        domain). 
 
        - please note that sound.m is given to help you install the
        module correctly on your system, and is just a modified Matlab

Sure, and still listening to this list. Currently I am still waiting
for a release of AF which supports MPEG audio (layer 2). Since I
donnot know if anybody else is working on this subject we try to 
port maplay (an public available MPEG audio player) to AF. MPEG stereo
audio sounds great on our SPARCstaion 10 but I would like to playback
MPEG audio streams on any platform with AF installed (especially my
AXP with an J300 board), so this port seems to be a reasonable first
step in the right direction. This work will be finished not until
spring 1995. However, I will put the code on our anonymous ftp server
if anybody would like to retrieve it.

We have two audiofile based projects running - one uses it as
part of an integrated messaging system;

the other was to have used it for building a virtual mixing desk,but the unavailability of the decAudio product may mean
moving to NetAudio on a PC,

but, has anyone got a 2nd hand decAudio (LoFi) they'd
be prepared to sell? 

(Neither project is in any way commercial)

   Tektronix, Inc. includes an AF server in the XP100, XP200, and XP350
   series of their X terminals.  We have local audio, MPEG video, and
   analog video players, and a Sun replacement driver that will redirect
   the /dev/audio device to an AF server (usually one of our X terminals).
   I'm planning to assist in the upcoming X Consortium work on the
   Common Audio effort as well (the extent of which is yet to be determined).

Hi,

I'm already working with a TX100 with XpressWare 7.0 and I realised that
you implemented in fact the AF server on the terminal. One can use directly
the aplay client to play an audio file without using xpsh. The same for
almost all other AF clients (apass, aset, arecord, etc). All you have to do
is to set the AUDIOFILE env. var to be the TX.

I'd be interested in Tektronix progress on two aspects:
1.
 X Consortium work on the Common Audio effort  (I don't know much about it).
2.
 Introducing IP multicast on TX

Could anybody tell me more about this?

Mat Hans asks,

          Where can I find information on "X Consortium work on 
          the Common Audio effort"?
  	
When more information is available, you will probably find it posted to the 
"audio" mailing list managed by the X Consortium. I believe that some 
introductory material is being collected currently, and should appear on 
that mailing list in the near future.

In general, the plan for CommonAudio is to take the best features from the 
AF design and from NAS, while reusing as much existing source code as 
possible.  Examples of features that are to be included in CommonAudio are 
the time model from AF, server-side sound buckets, some support for 
"flows", and resampling.

 Tom Levergood

To which I reply, how can one get on this audio mailing list? Sounds (excuse 
the pun) as if it is quite relevant to my work.

Are there plans to support playback over WAN that has more variations
in packet inter-arrival time -- such as implementing schemes to adjust 
playout delay like those in vat, nevot?

Send mail to "audio-request@x.org" I think.

Dealing with this was discussed in some preliminary CommonAudio design 
discussions --- in other words, I understand this is considered a desirable 
feature for the CA design.

   Yes.  Most .wav files are just little-endian PCM data files.
   The trick is to select the sample rate, data width, and mono/stereo,
   all of which is included in the .wav header structures.
   The AFSox library will load .wav files and set the appropriate
   sample rates, etc., if you can figure out how it works :-)

Hi friends,

I am planning to do echo cancellation on the DECaudio's DSP56k.
Thanks to Tom Levergood's starting information and suggestions on
the matter.  

However, I have never posted to this mailing list.  So today, I am
doing so to see if anyone else has doing this work on the DECaudio
so we may exchange ideas and experiences :-)  

Please reply directly to me if possible.

Regards,

Khoi Nguyen.

Hmm...coming from the ARPA Speech Recognition community, I'd have to
disagree with the statement that "most .wav files are just PCM".  In
fact, most of the Gigs of speech data we have in .wav format are
compressed in various ways.  The most current lossless compression is
something called "shorten".

There is a version of the NIST Sphere libraries that is newer than what
I believe is in AF.  Perhaps someone could incorporate the new NIST
library.  I could probably track down the source for the new NIST
library if someone wants it.

Sorry if I flush your email.

I would like to restate my points slightly regarding my previous email
on the DECaudio's DSP56k.

I am actually interested in exchanging ideas and information on any
development work for the DSP56k on the DECaudio, not neccessarily
the echo cancellation.

Thanks a lot for your time. 

Khoi Nguyen.

Any compression done on WAV files is in exception to the latest 
Microsoft Specification. It, of course, would not be the first time
that de Jure standards have cropped up. WAV files are a very
particular kind of RIFF file based on the Electronic Arts standard.
The spec describes the data chunk of a WAV file as little endian
PCM. I doubt you will find much in the way of commercial software
or average users with the ability to support in chunk compression.
Although sophisticated users of AF who have workstations on their
desktops may, these are far from 'most' or 'average' users. I would
have to say that 'most' 'average' users apply zip or the like to the 
entire WAV file when they want to compress it, thus rendering it 
unusable until decompressed.

I sure hope we're talking about different file types.  What a nightmare,
having Microsoft specify the files.

The .wav files I'm talking about are NIST Sphere files, and have been in
existence for at least five years.  The NIST standard has evolved
slightly over the last few years to include various types of lossless
compression.  The NIST Sphere files are extensively used by the speech
recognition community, particularly for data collected for ARPA and the
LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium).  We probably have 100 CD-ROMs full of
this data.

I sure hope Microsoft has nothing to do with this.  This sounds like a
file suffix conflict (two different .wav types).  Now, I don't know what
the original person was talking about when they were wondering about
support for .wav files.

(BTW, there is a version of the NIST Sphere library included with AF.  I
was just pointing out that it wasn't current.)

   WAV files are a particular kind of RIFF file which includes a field
   to identify the type of encoding used for the data.  Quite a number
   of encodings are available.  Microsoft has simply stated that "their"
   standard encoding is little-endian PCM, although I have come across
   other encodings.
   
   I did not mean to imply that little-endian PCM encodings were the ONLY
   type available, just that these were the most prevelant in *MY* experience.
   Of course, I have seen more WAV files from Microsoft users than others,
   so this has most likely biased my observations.

Thanks for the correction. I have an older copy of the 
MS Multimedia developers kit. I checked with Microsoft and they have
 added an implementation of the Sony ADPCM compression to their 
WAV spec. It seems that although they haven't released it yet they may 
be adding a third type using another compression scheme.

Sounds different. Where could I get a copy of the NIST WAV file spec?

I have almost completed a preliminary port of AFR3 to FreeBSD.  I believe
the "/dev/dsp" code is similar with Linux, so it may be pretty easy to get 
it to run on Linux too.

I still have some problems with the mixing tables -- in fact, any help
as to why they just seem to add noise to the samples would be appreciated.

I will announce to this list when I am finished with the FreeBSD port.
(So far all appropriate clients and contribs seem to work...)

   Holger Reif and Kevin Fowler reported problems with the latest
   AF3R1.tar.Z file in crl.dec.com:/pub/DEC/AF .  I just fetched it
   and found that it does not untar correctly under SunOS.  Previous
   versions of this file did work.

   The main problem seems to be the tar file labels directories as
   normal files (verified using 'tar tvf'), and so extracting the
   first ./AF entry from the tar archive creates a file and causes
   subsequent extractions to fail.

   The only work-around I have found is to use GNU's tar (gtar), which
   does the right thing (once you delete the AF file from previous
   extraction attempts).
   
   This AF3R1.tar.Z file looks suspect to me, as earlier versions and
   AF3R1-patches.tar.Z do not have a problem.

The setld kits are not up-to-date, and should be considered "unsupported".

I haven't yet decided whether to eventually get them up to date or to blow 
them away. In the meantime, please use AF3R1.tar.Z and my apologies for any 
pain this may cause you.

Subject: nsamples too big???
To: af
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 95 2:58:25 EST

I need help,

        I am running something close to aplay and it is always
giving me this error:

	hifi_write_back: nsamples too big, 5281.

I do not understand why? I looked at the code and it seems
to me that I am not writing too much into memory all at one
time. Moreover even the installed aplay seems to give me the 
same errors.

I wonder if anyone can shed any clue on this problem?

thanks,
araz

Subject: Getting AF Running on a HP 712

Hi All,

I have managed to compile AF on my HP 712 running HPUX 9.05 using the HP 
port done by Charles Henrich, although I have not been able to get 
anything out of the machine, although when I run the Ahpux program I 
loose all the sound from my machine, could this be a problem with output 
ports etc.?

So if any of you AF users (HP or not) have any idea's why this is 
happening please help.

Thanks in advance, hoping to hear something from you and my machine soon....

Mark

Subject: Asparc10 server problem?
Reply-To: ilh@LCS.MIT.EDU

I'm having difficulty with the Asparc10 server.  Try this:

	% apass -delay 0.5 -id 1 -od 1

I get horrible noise.  Device 2 does the same.  It doesn't seem to
matter what encoding type or server sampling rate I choose.

The following causes a Bus error on the server:

	% apass -delay 0.5 -id 0 -od 0 -e IEEED

(Not that I really care about the IEEED format, but it does dump core.)

Any ideas?  I'm running on a SPARC 20 MP and compiled AF3R1 with gcc
2.6.0.

Thanks in advance.

Date: Mon, 06 Feb 95 18:44:23 +0100
From: max@cis.uni-muenchen.de

Hi
I have two Alpha's. One with a lofi card (OSF 3.0), the other alpha 
(OSF2.1, just lended) with internal bba. I must take the machine with 
bba to an exhibition and want to use my program for speechoutput on this 
machine. The bba driver is already configured:
# strsetup -ic
            dlb     device      53       5010
            bba     device      54      24880
        bufcall     module                  0

But the audioserver says :
dda can't open /dev/lofi, errno message "No such file or directory"
This is clear . I want to use bba ?
What can I do ?
How do I have to start the audioserver. Which device Do I have to use 
for output ?
Thanks a lot
MAX

If your audio server is looking for /dev/lofi, you must be running Alofi.
If you want to use the built-in bba device, you must run the Aaxp audio
server, which was probably also built when you built Alofi.

For using the lofi (DECaudio) card, you use Alofi. If you want to use 
the baseboard audio, (bba), use Aaxp instead.

Subject: DTMF Detection

Hi there,

I'm using AF on a DEC 3000 and will soon have a DecAudio module to use as well.
Generating DTMF tones seems simple enough, either using Adial, Aphone, or by
using AFTonePair directly.
But is there a relatively simple way or detecting DTMF tones and distinguishing
them? If there is not, does anyone have any ideas ? (Can I compare an input with
a sample of each tone or do I need a Fast Fourier transform?)

Any ideas on an electronic postcard please?

Thanks,

Bruce.

Subject: blocking vs. non-blocking recording problems
Reply-To: ilh@LCS.MIT.EDU

With the Asparc10 server and a client running on a Sparc, I'm having
some problems with non-blocking recording.  In particular, if I specify
ANoBlock and attempt to read samples with type IMA, I get garbage
(mostly).  If I specify ABlock and type IMA, I get good samples.  What's
the deal?  It doesn't matter which server device I select.  Scalar types
like LIN16 and MU255 work fine in either blocking or non-blocking mode.

Is this a server or a client library problem?  Maybe this problem isn't
specific to Suns.

I can supply code that exercises the problem if desired.

Subject: Dec 3000 Headset?
Message-Id: <CMM.0.90.4.792209724.marko@jamuna.Stanford.EDU>

Sorry if this has been dealt with before... I saw the question but not
the answer in the archives.

I need to know how to tell AF whether to send sound to my internal
speaker or to my headset, on a DEC 3000/300 AXP.  Currently it only
goes to my speaker, and so annoys the rest of the building.

Please cc replies to me directly, as I am not yet subscribed to this
mailing list.

Thanks,

Marko

Subject: AF Sample rate conversions


Hello,

I am currently working on a project using Audiofile on a DEC 3000 with
a DecAudio module. The project involves sample conversion to CD quality.

I seem to be having problems with sample rate conversions and mixing.
I am currently using the following code for ulaw samples:

	tpACC=AConvertAllocInit(MU255,8000,1,LIN16,44100,2);

Using the above with AConvert() on ulaw encoded samples works for the most 
part, but seems to add random clicking noises to the output. This also 
happens when I try playing more than one CD quality sample on a server
at a time.

I am also having problems converting from 8bit linear (LIN8) to 16 bit linear
(LIN16), ie the following code returns a null pointer:

	tpACC=AConvertAllocInit(LIN8,44100,1,LIN16,44100,2);

Does this mean that this type of conversion is not supported?

I have written my own code to handle the conversion, but it would be nice
to have a common interface for several different types of conversion.

I would very much appreciate any help or comments on the above.

This is my second request for help,
I am running AF on an alpha using lofi as the device.
I am trying to run CD quality samples using the standard aplay
provided by AF. I get the following error during the playback.
when it happens there is an intrupption of the sound and then it 
plays again. I have tried to look at the code but cannot figure 
out how it works. 

Any help would be appreciated. 

thanks,

Hello,

I am working on the dsp56k of DECaudio.  I looked into the 
AudioFile-R2/AF.mips/server/dda/lofi/dsp56k/Makefile and found the map56 file
is used in linking of main.cln.  I looked around in AudioFile but can not
find map56 file anyway.  

Does any one know where I can get it?  Do I need to have it when linking the
main.cln?

Thank you very much for your help in advance.

Sincerely,

Khoi.

I have completed a port of AFR3 to FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.

Many clients and contribs work fine!  

What is the recommended distribution method?

1. Place the whole release on an ftp site at uwm (separate from 
   official release?)
2. Merge it with the official release? (If so, how...)
3. Prepare a patchkit? 
4. ???

It should be very easy to port this to FreeBSD 2.x and LINUX.

BTW xboing even works using AF!

Let me know what you think!

Hi,

    I am looking for a program that can normalize volume to a specified
level for say, a ulaw file.  Or perhaps an 'arecord' that records 
directly to a specified volume.

    Any reference/help is much appreciated.  Thanks!

A patchkit would be great! I can distribute it with the next upgrade.

Just put it on your ftp server and let me know where it is...

Can you please tell me where to get the port (I did not see

I`m interested in porting to Linux.

Sender: aswan@woodstock.cs.berkeley.edu

I've been having problems with an application developed locally
that uses AudioFile.  It works fine on Sparcs and HP's (I can't
seem to set the output gain on the HP's but that's another issue)

I start an AudioFile server, run the local application, and after
it exits, the AF server seems to be completely dead.  Things are
fine as long as my app is running, but once it quits, I can't seem
to get any sound.  The AF server is still there -- other commands
work and aplay seems to work in that it exits after the length of
the clip has elapsed.  But again, no sound comes out.

I know that AFCloseAudioConnection() is being called if that
matters.  The machine in question is a Dec 3000 with a j300 board,
but just using the Aaxp server.  Any thoughts about what I might be
doing (or not doing) to cause this problem?

I am not on the af mailing list so please be sure that I get a
copy of any response.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: *BSD port?? 
To: af
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 95 14:57:51 MET
Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85]
Content-Length: 1017

Hello everyone,

I just downloaded the AF3R1 archive and it's patches, since I am 
considering to use it for my graduation project. Now I was wondering
if there is a port of AF for the enviroment I am going to be working
under. 

The enviroment will be:
NetBSD 1.0 (I think) on an Intel 486 (and Pentium soon) with a
Soundblaster16 card for audio.

Now I have seen a message about a port for FreeBSD, but I lost it.

So my questions are:
1) Is there a port of AF3R1 for NetBSD?
2) Would the FreeBSD port work for NetBSD?
3) If ther is a port for *BSD (under Intel) then I would like
   to know where I can find it.

Thanks in advance for your help,
Robert

Hi,

does anybody know how to connect an aplay client to some
AFservers in the same time (think about several TXs with
audio extentions based on AFserver). As I thought at TXs there is no question
of multicast (IP multicast extentions are not *yet* implemented
by TXs providers, as far as I know)

Thank for any hint,

Lucia.Gradinariu@univ-lyon1.fr

Several people contacted me about my AF port to FreeBSD so that they may
work on a Linux port.  It might make sense for this list of people
to contact each other to help reduce redundant effort. 

If you are one of these people, is it okay if I put your e-mail address 
on the list?

Should this list be sent to the af@crl.dec.com mail-list?

I'm using a DEC 3000-300LX with the J300 board. I use this machine for mbone 
audio/video. When I load the Aj300 server I can receive audio fine (output) but 
I am unable to send audio using the mic.

This may not be a problem with the AF software but with the VAT application. But 
I need to start somewhere.  The built-in audio works fine with the Aaxp server 
and the VAT application.


And a second question. Is there a way with AF to disable the external speaker on 
a 3000-300?  When I use the Aaxp server and the phone jack I don't want the 
internal speak to blast away.

Short of disconnecting the wire by hand (which is a pain because the
speaker is sealed in the power supply chasis) there doesn't appear to
be a way to do this.  I'd be happy to be corrrected.

Just compiled the latest Xanim (V2.69.7.7, Audio Beta) and saw that sound
support for AF was included. (done by none other than our esteemed colleague
Tom Levergood - bravo! ;-)

It compiles without a hitch but any Quicktime or AVI file that I play with
sound enabled causes the app to dump core. Here's the stack trace:

I have the AF3 binary/development kit (AF3XXX100) installed on my OSF/1 V3.0

You're passing UINT_MAX (i.e. probably -1) as the device parameter to
AFCreateAC. In fact, you're passing 5 args when only 4 are expected.
Something has certainly gone wrong there.

I should mention that the setld kit in the ftp distribution is probably
out of date. Several people have had problems with it, and unless somebody
volunteers to build a new one, I will remove it from the next release.

So you should probably build from AF3R1.tar.Z instead.

X-Shipping: Forties, 1004, falling 7.


Does anyone know how to get AF working on an AlphaStation 400 4/233?
I assume the driver to use is Amsb, which has built fine.  The node
exists, but the driver fails with

msbInit: Cannot open /dev/msb0
Device busy

Fatal audio server error:
Cant open device

I put a line into the kernel config file:

controller      msb0       at isa0      slot?   vector    msbintr 

My suspicion is that I've got into a muddle with device drivers - I
ran `shlib -l .' in AF/devices/axp150/msb/output/, and this replaced
some system files in /usr/include/io/dec/eisa.  With hindsight, these
are for a different machine.  Sigh.

Is Multimedia Services running on your platform?
(ps auxgww | grep mmeserver)

If so, you have to stop that and just run AF. There's a startup script
in /sbin/rc3.d/S??mmeserver. Execute that with a stop argument and then
rename the script to be X??mmeserver to keep it from running after
reboot.

Hi,

The Distributed Systems Research Group at OGI CSE just finished a
distributed MPEG video audio player. The source code is now available
at:

ftp://cse.ogi.edu/pub/dsrg/Player.

This player uses AudioFile as audio output.

We would like to thank you for making the AudioFile software available
to us.

Best wishes,

No - nothing like it.  I had a play around with the boot monitor

Subject: Problem with AF on Dec 5000
Date: Mon, 03 Apr 1995 01:55:45 -0700
Sender: aswan@woodstock.cs.berkeley.edu

A user of a package that I have been working on is reporting
problems with AF on his Dec 5000 (running Ultrix 4.2A).

The problem seems to be in querying the output gain; running
"aset q" shows a minimum and maximum gain of 0.  I presume
this just means that the gain cannot be changed.  However,
if AFQueryOutputGain() is called more than once, the application
crashes with "AFProtoError: aBadValue".  Any idea what the
problem is or how to fix it?

(I can avoid calling AFQueryOutputGain() more than once if
 that's necessary, but it seems like something else strange
 is going on...)

Thanks in advance for any help.

Hi All,

 Where do I get the source code for the AF program aplay ?
I have a DEC Alpha workstation on which I cannot locate the source but
I am able to use the executable. I need the source badly. Is there any
other place on the net where I can get hold of this code. If you have
sample code please mail it to : srinivas@cs.iastate.edu and not to this
list as I am not a member on this.

Thanks very much for your time !

Dear All,
	I wanted to get some information on Profiling the audio 
server. I am using Aaxp and profiled it using the pixie and the
profile utilities. But the problem is that Aaxp runs in the back
ground and I cannot make out when it is servicing the audio stream.
I wanted to find out the time the Audio server spends on a audio 
stream. Any help would be appreciated.

General Topics

  1. Which platforms have AF server support?
     Currently, AF3 servers exist for the following systems:
          OSF/1 for Alpha, TURBOchannel-based Workstations
                    Aaxp manages the base-board audio hardware on Alpha
                    workstations.
                    Aj300 manages the J300 Sound and Motion TURBOchannel audio
                    hardware.
                    Alofi manages the LoFi/DECaudio TURBOchannel audio
                    hardware.
                    Ajv manages the J-Video prototype TURBOchannel audio
                    hardware.
          OSF/1 for Alpha, Alpha PC 150
                    Amsb manages the Microsoft Sound Board audio hardware on an
                    Alpha PC.
          Ultrix/RISC
                    Alofi manages the LoFi/DECaudio TURBOchannel audio
                    hardware.
                    Amaxine manages the base-board audio hardware on Personal
                    DECstations.
                    Ajv manages the J-Video prototype TURBOchannel audio
                    hardware.
          SGI Irix
                    Asgi manages the audio hardware on Indigo.
          SunOS
                    Asparc manages the base-board audio hardware on
                    Sparcstations.
                    SparcStation 10 dda support coming soon?
  2. Can I use the AUDIOFILE environment variable to indicate which audio
     device I want to use?
     No. The AUDIOFILE variable is used to specify the default audio server to
     connect with and cannot be used to select the audio device within an audio
     server.

     See the Connection Name section in one of the server man pages for more
     details about the format of this environment variable (e.g., Aj300).

  3. How do I select an audio device?
     A server will support one or more audio devices numbered [0...N). The
     simplest way to probe the list of audio devices is to use the aset client
     application,

                     aset q


     and examine the result. The output is formatted as a table with each row
     describing an audio device's attributes, and current state.

     The mapping of an audio device to a connector on the audio hardware is
     server specific.
  4. Is there a GUI front-end for aplay that I can use with Mosaic?
     There is a simple Tk-based application called tkPlay in the
     contrib/clients tree within AF3. tkPlay allows you to control the output
     audio device, output gain, as well as other aplay command line switches.
     This app depends on having Tcl/Tk installed before use.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


New Features in AF3

  1. Some server's audio devices export linear PCM-16 datatypes and others
     export mu-law. Will the server do datatype conversion for me?
     Yes. Clients can set the encoding type for playing or recording samples
     through an Audio Context. Clients can select among all popular scalar
     datatypes and several compressed datatypes; the audio server will
     automatically perform the datatype conversion for the client application.

  2. Do the servers also support compressed datatypes?
     Yes. For example, IMA, GSM, a computationally simple ADPCM algorithm (2,3,
     and 4 bit quanitization), etc.
  3. Does AF understand structured audio file formats?
     With AF3, we now include a customized version of the SOX library (Wes
     Whitnah, Tektronix). However, while this permits you to more easily write
     client apps that read and write structured audio file formats, the common
     apps in AF3 (aplay and arecord) do not yet have knowledge of file formats.
     This will be corrected soon.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Servers

  1. Why is the performance of the Amaxine server so poor (on the Personal
     DECstation)?
     The performance woes on the Personal DECstation are mostly due to the
     device driver. We no longer have Personal DECstations at CRL and will not
     try to improve the performance. We would welcome contributions if you
     choose to make source code changes that significantly improve the
     performance.
  2. Why do I get bba: ISDN_DMA_ERROR error messages on the console of my
     Personal DECstation? Can I safely ignore these messages?
     These are error messages from the bba driver on the Personal DECstation
     (these messsage do not occur on other systems). You cannot make it stop
     other than by not running applications that use the /dev/bba device, (e.g.
     the Amaxine server). Although a few audio samples are lost when this
     occurs, you can otherwise safely ignore these messages.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Building AF3 and AF3 Clients

  1. How do I create a client AF Makefile from an Imakefile?
     Use the amkmf utility (not xmkmf) which is typically installed in
     /usr/local/bin/AF/amkmf.
  2. I am having trouble building AF3 on 4.3a/4.4 of Ultrix, am I doing
     something wrong?
     I do not understand the exact cause of the problem, but it is related to
     the new compiler provided with Ultrix 4.3a. The compiler includes a
     backwards compatibility switch (see the cc man page). Add the -oldc switch
     to your default ccflags def in ultrix.cf (DefaultCCOptions) and try
     rebuilding the World. I believe this will "fix" your problems.

  3. I try to build AF3 from source and I get complaints about dependencies on
     files that do not exist. What am I doing wrong?
     One of the more common problems with people building from an original
     source kit is not following the make World instructions. AF3 uses many of
     the same tools and configuration utilities as does X11, including the
     program imake. One of the first steps that occurs when rebuilding World is
     to make your local imake which is subsequently used to rebuild all
     Makefiles in the hierarchy. Later, dependencies are created in the new
     Makefiles.

     The problem alluded to by the question is typically caused by attempting
     to short-cut the process and build specific binary targets using the
     Makefiles included in the original source kit.

  4. Can I build AF3 on Solaris (V2.3, the AF documentation only refers to
     SunOS 4.1.3)?
     Shortly after the release of AF3R1, there should be a patch kit available
     that will enable you to build and use AF3 under Solaris (Wes Whitnah,
     Tektronix).

Related Topics

  1. What applications exist? (Under construction)
     In addition to the core applications and the contributed applications
     within the kit, the following applications have been announced:
          Distributed karoke system using AF and Tcl/Tk.
          sgutfreund@gte.com
          This list is under construction. If you wish to make additions to
          this list, please send mail to af-bugs@crl.dec.com and state the name
          of the application, what it does, the name of the author, and how to
          get it.
  2. How do I make contributions?
     We welcome contributed clients or libraries as long as they carry a
     similar copyright notice as the core AF kit. Should you wish to make a
     contribution to the AF kit, send mail to the af-bugs@crl.dec.com to ask
     for specific information.
  3. What features are being planned for the future?
     The most significant change under consideration is to include a general
     sampling rate conversion utility within the server (similar to encoding
     datatype conversion) to allow client applications to view an audio device
     as having their own preferred sampling-rate (with AF3 clients can select
     the datatype.)
  4. Is AF "supported"?
     AF is not officially supported. AF is distributed in source code form with
     an fairly unrestrictive copyright. We use AF for audio and speech research
     here at CRL and support it on a best effort basis. Since it is distributed
     in source code, we welcome bug fixes (preferably in the form of patches to
     the last released source code kit.)
  5. How does AF3 relate to NETaudio?
     Both are relatively popular distributed audio systems. While they both
     have some features in common, AF uniquely provides the device-time
     feature. We are working together with NCD towards developing a common
     audio system that incorporates the better features of both Netaudio and
     AF.

  6. Where can I get the Ak kit?
     crl.dec.com:/pub/misc/ak-0.7.tar.Z
  7. What are the current mailing lists/newsgroups for AF3?

     af@crl.dec.com          General af mailing list topics
     af-bugs@crl.dec.com     Send problem reports to this list
     af-request@crl.dec.com  For (un)subscribing to the af list

Hi, I have a DEC 3000 Alpha running OSF/1.

I am looking for someone who has gotten rplay to work on there system.  I
need a /dev/audio faker or something similiar to make it work.  I have
now a faker for /dev/audio but, it can only have either write 
or read permissions.  I cannot have both.  If you have something that 
makes rplay work under OSF/1.  It would be greatly appreciated or if you 
could lead me in the right direction to get help.

Thanx,

Hello,

I have built and installed AF3R1.tar.Z on a DEC 3000/500 running OSF/1
V3.2 (actually post 3.2 in development). Everything built and installed
OK, but I can't make 'aplay' to work yet. Before I go on applying the
patches provided in AF3R1-patches.tar, I thought I should first ask
if there are any known problems/workarounds. Here is the output of
the basic commands that I am trying:

First I run ./Aaxp in the background.

./aset q
Server fast1.zk3.dec.com:0.0, device summary:

19      SAMPLE_CELP1015
20      LAST_NUMBER_DIALED


When I run aevents, it doesn't show anything (even when running aplay),
except when I kill Aaxp:
# /usr/local/bin/AF/aevents
IO:  fatal IO error 32 (Broken pipe) on Audio server "fast1.zk3.dec.com:0.0
"
      after 4 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
      The connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or KillClient.


When I run aplay bob.snd, it takes a few seconds and it seens to finish
doing whatever it is doing - I am trying to hear the sound using headphones
attached to the front plug (I tested this also usind xcd and a CD, and
that works). 

Can anyone see anything wrong in my configuration? Any words of wisdom?

You can reply directly to me and I will post a summary.

Thanks,

	Dirce

Thanks to your quick replies! Of course I was expecting to hear
the sound from the same plug as the CDROM (!). 

My sandpiper has the phone plug on the back, and I pluged my phone
handset there and now I can hear bob.snd.

Hi,

 is there a chance with the included/contributed clients (i.e. without 
programming) to do the following (cf. sketch): Host A does a recording, 
forwards the audiodata to Host B and Hosts C1...Cn get the audio data from 
Host B and do playing them. The reason is, that Host A is connected via a 
slow link with Host B, C1, ..., Cn. But the links from B to C have wide 
bandwith.
                                      +------+
                                      |  C1  | --<
                                      +------+
                                      +------+
    +-----+          +-----+       \  |  C2  | --<
O|--|  A  | -------> |  B  | =======  +------+
    +-----+          +-----+       /     ...
rec.                                  +------+
                                      |  Cn  | --<
                                      +------+
                                                play

Between Hosts A and B is the possibility to share a filesystem.

Has anyone any ideas? 
Comments and hints are welcome!

Hi,

I have been trying to install AF on an Alpha station 200 4/166 running
OSF1 V3.0 358.78 (because I want to use vat)

I added the bba line from from /sys/conf/GENERAL to my configuration 
file and ran doconfig with that file. After rebooting I noticed 
a /dev/streams/bba:

  crw-rw-rw-   1 root     system    32, 58 Apr 12 16:33 /dev/streams/bba

and the command /found that the command usr/bin/mme/audiodevices says:

  No device ID specified
  Getting capabilities for all Wave MME devices

  Wave Input Device 0
  ====================
  Product ID      : 22    (ALPHA-AXP Microsoft Sound Board compatible)
  Product Name    : Microsoft Sound Board compat.
  ....

So I guess it has the Microsoft Sound Board.  I then built the AF stuff
from AF3R1.tar.Z where patchlevel.h indicates that the PATCHLEVEL is 11. I
simply unpacked and did make World

Finally I tried Amsb :0 -device /dev/streams/bba and the machine crashed. 
Just for good measure I tried all the servers thatthe system had built
(Aaxp, Aconf, Aj300, Ajv, Alofi and Amsb) and the only one which did not
crash the machine was AConf - however as this does not use the hardware
this I not what I want. 

Do you know which server should I use and what I might have done wrong
please? 

Regards,

Steve Fisher

Subject: trouble compiling AF for Solaris2.4 with gcc
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 1995 13:37:22 -0400
From: Ed Hurley <hurley@mama-bear.lcs.mit.edu>


hi,

i was wondering if anyone had compiled AF for Solaris2.4 with gcc
and whether they might be willing to help me out.

-i'm using the latest AF3R1 (as of 3-4 days ago) with patchlevel 11.

-i'm using gcc 2.6.3.

-i'm compiling on a standalone sparc20 with the complete solaris install,
 and am building in the source directory.

-i'm following the directions in the RELNOTES.txt and README-V3, at least
 as i interpret them.

when i try to do "make BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS='-DHOSTBIN -Dsun -Dsparc -DSVR4' World"
the following happens:

1) make Makefiles executes fine, although a number of directories report:
	Nothing to be done for Makefiles
   that seems reasonable.

2) make clean seems to execute ok, although i get a few:
	warning: overriding commands for target .c.o

3) make includes runs ok, except for a few more:
	warning: overriding commands for target .c.o

4) make depend bombs. here's the first few errors:

	main.c:35: warning: `_POSIX_C_SOURCE' redefined
	/usr/include/sys/feature_tests.h:26: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
	parse.o(.text+0x63c): undefined reference to `_ctype_'

   since makedepend doesn't get built, what comes after quickly fails.

does anyone have any insight into what's happening? i'd really appreciate any 
help.

thanks,
-ed

Hi,

I have now succeeded in installing AF on an Alpha station 200 
4/166 running OSF1 V3.0 358.78 along with vat 3.4 

I said before that I had added the bba line from from /sys/conf/GENERAL to
my configuration file and ran doconfig with that file and that the machine
then crashed with any servers. It was pointed out to me by someone from
CRL that I should not have used the bba because this machine has the
Microsoft compatible board. So I ran doconfig to return the kenel to its
original state amd then after stopping the mmeserver which was occupying
the hardware I was able to say Amsb :0 -device /dev/msb0

Vat 3.4 then worked but with one odd problem - the thing crashes
(consistently) if you move the microphone slider more than half way up. 

Regards,

Steve Fisher

Hi,

	This may be a completely stupid question, but I've compiled AF properly,
but I can't install it. This is the message I get:-

*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'
Current working directory /opt/local/src/AFdir/AF/config

I'm running Solaris 2.4 on a Sparc 20.

Subject: audio on DEC2100/500 server?

Excuse me if this is a silly question.  We've been using Aaxp
successfully on DEC ALPHA workstations for some time, via the
baseboard audio thingy.

We are just commissioning a 2100/500 server and, although it
isn't our plan to use that as an AV platform as such, I was
wondering whether it can do audio output as standard.  The
hardware booklet mentions a loudspeaker interface, in such a way
that I believe in may come as standard, but I've found no further
information about it.  I tried running various of the servers 
in the AF package, but none of them seem to be able to locate
their device.

Maybe I'm overlooking something obvious...?

I've been using AF for DEC alpha 3000 OSF/1 V3.0.
My problem is that whenever I listen to World Radio Network

the headset. Does anybody out there know how to do this?
afxctl or aset or anything doesn't seem to have the option.
Thanks.

Subject: AF's hifi_write_back: nsamples too big error
To: af
Date: Tue, 23 May 95 13:00:13 EDT


Hi out there,

I am using AF with LoFi card on a DEC Alpha.

But when I run Alofi on HIFI mode using
the AF's aplay, I get this "hifi_write_back: nsamples too big" error
periodically. 

if you have EVER encountered this problem, can you please
contact me. First of all I need to know if other
people have had this problem or is it just me.
secondly if you have any understanding of how 
the lofi server works, then it would be real helpful.
(at the end is what I gathered from my debugging).

any help would be appreciated.
thanks in advance, 

araz

-----------------------------------------------


what I have found out:
I have narrowed down the problem, it happens from 
hifiUpdate in server/dda/lofi/hifi.c.

It seems to me that I get the error when 

aDev->time0 + aDev->privPtr->guardBandTicks - aDev->timeNextUpdate  

			> 	HIFI_HWBUF(4096)

I do  not understand why this would ever happen but it does.

can you help, please.

thanks

Hi,

I've a TX100 from Tektronix with Xpress Ware V7.0 on it and 12Mo of memory.
It has an implementation of AF3R1 and accepts all clients and contrib.clients
from this distribution.
I'd like to know what amount of memory is necessary in order to do some
concurrent X-Display and AF "things" in the same time (like adjusting
output level in an axset window while running afft on a file) without
blocking the terminal's X-Display server and AF server and having to reboot it?
It's a problem of performance test I cann't manage.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

   12MB of memory should be enough for most work.  This is the amount I have
   in my XP350 (same memory use as the XP100) which I use for my daily work
   and audio/video testing.  Some applications require more depending on
   how many fonts, pixmaps, etc. that it stores on the X server.  More memory
   is also needed if you intend to run very many local clients.  I've used
   the axset and afft combination you've mentioned without problems, as well
   as running multiple audio connections, video, X applications, and a local
   window manager (OLWM and XPWM).  The audio and X servers are separate and
   should not interfere with each other, nor should a terminal reboot be
   necessary to break connections.

   From your question I'm not sure if you are experiencing a problem or not.
   If you are email me directly what you are doing and experiencing and I'll
   be able to help.  Also it would be a good idea to contact your local sales
   person to upgrade to XpressWare V8.0 or get the latest V7.0 patch, as an
   important audio bug has been fixed in these releases.

It seems to me that most of the AF documentation is directed towards
how to install the server.  I'm having a bugger of a time trying to
figure out how the API works.  Having a "hello world" program would
really help (and seems quite appropriate for an audio toolkit!).

I've grokked the html files - only give manpage references to functions,
but no idea how functions are put together or WHY?  I thought aplay.c
would be a good starter, but it obviously wasn't meant as a tutorial.
My last gasp is to go through the mail archives.  (Eight zillion
[un]subscribe messages.)  I did find:

	Yes.  Most .wav files are just little-endian PCM data files.
	The trick is to select the sample rate, data width, and mono/stereo,

	The AFSox library will load .wav files and set the appropriate

This is exactly what I want to do - play WAVE files I'm generating

But how to figure it out?

ps - info on the linux port would be great as well!

Subject: Alphastation 400 and 200, AF
X-Shipping: Forties, 1004, falling 7.

A couple of months ago I asked about getting AF to work on an
Alphastation 400, but got nowhere.  After speaking to DEC's helpline
I'm even more confused.  The story so far...

We have two types of Alphastation with soundcards: Alphastation 400
4/233 types, with cards with the Microsoft logo on; and Alphastation
200 4/166 types, with a smaller soundcard.

AF comes with a device driver for the microsoft board.  It suggests
putting it onto a floppy, configuring the machine for NT, installing
the driver and then reconfiguring for OSF/1.  I think, however, this
is for an earlier model of AlphaPC (?).

The 400s don't seem to have a driver installed, the 200s seem to have
one.

I remember someone on this list saying he had got a 200 to work - it
came with multimedia services installed, and you have to stop that
daemon to release the hardware.  On our 200s, simply typing `file
/dev/msb0' crashes the machine.  I imagine the device isn't configured
properly.

The DEC guy seems to think that the boards are only in there in the
first place so you can run NT - there are no OSF device drivers for
them.  He couldn't explain how multimedia services got round that.

I'd appreciate it if anyone could confirm or deny any of these points.

Phil Garner.

So the AlphaStation 200 4/166 installation was successful.

At any rate, I know that AF works on Avantis (AlphaStation 400 4/233) because 
we have a bunch of them running it here. If you really get into a jam then 
I'll ask our systems person about this (but believe me, he's really busy :-)...

There's a bug in the msb kernel driver shipped with OSF/UNIX. If the
board is not properly configured, you will panic or hang your machine.

The Multimedia Services layered product, available on the Consolidated
Layered Product CD, has a version of the msb that won't cause this, but
you'll still need to configure your msb correctly.

Here's the information we have in our installation scripts. Hope this
helps a bit. If you get the configuration correct, the msb driver
shipped with the base OS will work.

By the way, the MSB is meant to be used for OSF/UNIX as well as NT.
There shouldn't be any problems.

Jim

     If your system has an EISA bus, and you have not previously
     done so, then you should run the Digital UNIX Eisa Configuration Utility
     (ECU) (shipped on a 3.5 inch diskette), prior to rebuilding your kernel.
     The reason for this is that the kernel rebuild process uses the
     NVRAM information stored by the ECU when creating the kernel
     configuration file.

     The ECU is invoked at the system console prompt (>>>) via the runecu
     command.  More detailed information about the ECU can be found
     in the hardware documentation shipped with your system.  Specific
     information and problems relating to the Microsoft Sound Board
     ECU configuration are described below.

     There are two versions of the Microsoft Sound Board ECU configuration
     file: !ISA2000.CFG and AISA2000.CFG.  The !ISA2000.CFG file should
     be used with systems running Digital UNIX V2.x; the AISA2000.CFG file
     should be used with Digital UNIX V3.0 or later.

     Known Problems:

     Using the AISA2000.CFG file on a Digital UNIX V2.x system can cause it to
     hang during the Digital UNIX boot.

     When running Digital UNIX V2.x, the device driver always uses dma channels
     0 and 1, regardless of the dma channel specified via the ECU
     process.


     If your ECU diskette is a version prior to V1.5, and/or was shipped
     with Digital UNIX V2.x or earlier, then your ECU diskette may not
     have an ECU configuration file (!ISA2000.CFG or AISA2000.CFG) which
     corresponds to the Microsoft Sound Board.

     You may obtain the !ISA2000.CFG file or the AISA2000.CFG file by
     continuing with the installation of the MMEMSB160 subset, and then
     declining to rebuild your kernel for any subsets which request it.
     Then issue the command 'setld -c MMEMSB160 ECU' to invoke the Build ECU
     utility which is included within this kit.  This utility will allow you
     to add either Microsoft Sound Board ECU configuration file onto your
     Digital UNIX ECU diskette.

     Steps to install driver on an EISA bus machine, after upgrading
     to a new Digital UNIX version, or when adding the Microsoft Sound Board
     to your ECU configuration:

     1.  Exit out of this installation, or else continue it, but do
         not rebuild your kernel.

     2.  Update your Digital UNIX ECU diskette (only necessary if obtained
         prior to Digital UNIX V3.0).  See previous paragraph for instructions.

     3.  Shutdown your system and run the ecu utility, adding the Microsoft
         Sound Board.

     4.  Install the sound card, if not installed.

     5.  Boot the genvmunix kernel ( >>>boot -fi "genvmunix" ).

     6.  Install the MMEMSB160 subset (using the 'setld -l' command),
         if not installed.

     7.  Rebuild the kernel when prompted to do so (as part of the MMEMSB160
         installation in step 5) or invoke a rebuild via the
         'setld -c MMEMSB160 INSTALL' command.  Select the option to create
         a new kernel configuration file.


     NOTES TO ABOVE STEPS:

     IF you are running Digital Unix V2.0 (this usually only applies to
     a DEC 2000 Model 300 or a DEC AXP150),

     AND
     IF support for all your devices is specified in an existing
     kernel configuration file,

     THEN

     In step 5, it is not necessary to boot the genvmunix kernel; and
     in step 7, it is not necessary to create a new kernel configuration file.


ISA_bus_information

     If you system has an ISA bus, then you should run the isacfg command
     at the system console prompt (>>>), prior to rebuilding your kernel.
     The reason for this is that the kernel rebuild process uses the NVRAM

     information stored by this command when creating the kernel
     configuration file.  Information on the isacfg console command
     is provided with the hardware documentation shipped with your
     system.  However, a detailed description of the syntax of the isacfg
     console command may be obtained at the next menu prompt.

     You may determine if the sound card is already configured by
     entering the console command "isacfg -all" or the console command
     "show config".  The sound card has the handle PCXBJ, and should also
     have values for the options iobase0, iobase1, irq0, dmachan0, and
     dmachan1.

     If your sound card is not configured, you normally can configure
     it by typing "add_sound" at the console prompt.  This command
     provides default values for all the sound card configuration
     options.


     Alternatively, you can enter an entire isacfg command, such as:
     >>>isacfg -mk -slot 2 -dev 0 -etyp 1 -handle PCXBJ -iobase0 530 iobase1
        388 -enadev 1 -irq0 9 -dmachan0 0 -dmachan1 3

     with other cards installed in your system.
     Following entry of new isacfg information, use the >>>init command
     to store the configuration.

     For more detail on the isacfg utility, select option "D", when
     the selection menu is presented to you again.

     Steps to install the Microsoft Sound Board device driver on an
     ISA bus machine, after upgrading to a new Digital UNIX version, or when
     adding the Microsoft Sound Board to your console configuration:

     1.  Exit out of this setld installation, or else continue it,
         but do not rebuild your kernel.

     2.  Shutdown and halt your system and use appropriate console
         configuration commands (isacfg, add_sound, init) in order to add
         the Microsoft Sound Board to your hardware configuration.

     3.  Install the sound card, if not installed.

     4.  Boot the genvmunix kernel ( >>> boot -fi "genvmunix" ).

     5.  Install the MMEMSB160 subset (using the 'setld -l' command),
         if not installed.

     6.  Rebuild the kernel when prompted to do so (as part of the MMEMSB160
         installation in step 5) or invoke a rebuild via the
         'setld -c MMEMSB160 INSTALL' command.  Select the option to create
         a new configuration file.

     ISA Configuration Utility
     -------------------------

     ISA devices are not capable of being probed for configuration
     information by the Digital UNIX or OpenVMS operating systems.
     Therefore, you must enter ISA option information manually using
     the ISA configuration utility (ISACFG). You should run this
     utility before installing a new ISA option module on Digital
     AlphaStation systems running either the Digital UNIX or OpenVMS
     operating systems.
     Command Format
     The syntax of the ISACFG command is:
     isacfg [-slot <slot#>] [-dev <device#>]
     [-all|-rm|-mk|-mod] [-<field> <value>] . . .


     Command Option     Description

     -all               Shows the entire configuration table.
                        Overrides all other commands.

     -dev <dev#>        Optional; defaults to 0 if not entered.
                        On a multifunction or multiport adapter, this
                        specifies the device on the adapter.

     -dmachan{0-3} <#>  Allows you to specify up to four DMA channels
                        for the device.
     -dmamode{0-3} <#>  Allows you to specify the DMA type for
                        -dmachan{0-3}. DMA modes are:

                           2 - Demand
                           4 - Single
                           8 - Cascade


     -enadev <#>        Allows you to specify whether an entry is
                        enabled or disabled.  Disabled devices are
                        not used in resource allocation calculations.
                        The possible values are:
                           0 - No (disabled)
                           1 - Yes (enabled)

     -etyp <#>          Defines an entry type for this entry.  The #
                        sign can be:
                           0 - Causes the entry to be deleted
                           1 - Single option
                           2 - Embedded multiport device
                           3 - Multiport option device

     -handle <string>   Binds a name to the driver (up to 15 characters).

     -init              Initializes the configuration table to the
                        default settings.

     -iobase{0-5} <#>   Specifies up to six I/O base registers
                        (in hexadecimal) for a particular device entry.

     -irq{0-3} <#>      Allows you to assign up to four IRQ (interrupt
                        request) channels to the device (use decimal
                        IRQ levels).

     -membase{0-2}  <#> Specifies up to three R/W ISA memory regions.

    -memlen{0-2} <#>   Specifies the length corresponding to membase{0-2}.

     -mk                Adds an entry into the table.

     -mod               Modifies an entry in the table.

     -rm                Deletes an entry from the table.

     -rombase <#>       Specifies an address for ISA BIOS ext. ROM.

     -romlen <#>        Specifies length of ROM.

     -slot <slot#>      Allows you to enter a unique slot number for
                        each ISA adapter.  You may assign the numbers
                        in any order.  The slot number does not relate
                        to a physical ISA adapter position. Slot 0 is
                        reserved for the local multiport adapter.


     -totdev <#>        Placeholder for you to keep track of the total
                        number of devices, specified by the # sign, at
                        this slot.  Modify this for your own use.

I can only imagine so.  That command (it's not shlib, some other 5
letter thing...) replaced some files in /usr/sys/... which caused
errors in the kernel rebuld.  I had to unpick what it had done by
hand.

Yeah... it gets even more curious.  I contacted Steve Fisher directly
and compared Kernel config files - and as far as I can tell I was
doing all the software stuff correctly.  I've been convinced for some
time that the problem lies in the card configuration and device
drivers, which is why I haven't bothered the AF list with it (until
yesterday).  Kind of as a matter of principle I want the DEC service
guys to figure it out.  Trouble is, the last one that came round here
managed to get his key stuck in the back of a machine and it broke
off.

Mind you - there's a message today from Jim Ludwig that seems to touch
on exactly what to do.  I'll follow that up and let you know what
happens.

Ta.

Well, with due thanks to Jim Ludwig for sending the correct
information, I'm half way there; I got AF to work on the Alphastation
400 4/233.  The board simply wasn't configured - I just configured it
and built a new kernel.  Amsb then works.  I'll append a guide to how
to do that, but meanwhile, back at the ranch, the 200 still won't
work.  I built a new kernel with the device driver updated from mme150
layered product, but the console reports an error `msb0: ACI bit never
reset' and Amsb core dumps.  This is an improvement on simply hanging
the machine though, and ties in with Jim's comment about the older
version of msb having a bug which would hang the machine IF the board
wasn't configured correctly.  I haven't a clue how to fix the
configuration though, it is the same as in add_sound.  The base
address is right - changing it prompts a warning at bootup that
there's nothing there.

Phil.


How to configure the sound board on an Alphastation 400 4/233:
--------------------------------------------------------------
(...or supposedly any Alphastation with an ISA bus)

1.  Tell the machine how the card is configured.

Bring the machine down to the boot monitor prompt (>>>) and run the
command `show config'.  The sound board should declare itself as
PCXBJ, probably in isa slot 2.  The isa slot number does not refer to
a physical slot in the machine, just an NVRAM entry.

If there is no sign of PCXBJ, run the command `add_sound'.  Hit the up
arrow key twice and hit return.  Take a moment to wonder why the boot
monitor has command line history.  Meanwhile, there should now be a
PCXBJ entry.  Run the command `more add_sound' to see what it actually
does.  Run `init' to store the new information into NVRAM.

Boot the machine on the generic kernel using `boot -fi "genvmunix"'.
Go to stage 2.


2.  Install a working version of the msb device driver.

Find a Layered Product CD with the Multimedia Sevices on it - that is,
with a directory called mmeXXX, where XXX is the version.  I used
mme150.  Run the commands `cd <cdrom_dir>/mme150/kit' followed by
`setld -l . MMEMSB150' (or follow your usual procedure for installing
subsets - you want the device driver subset though).  This will update
the msb driver.  You will be given the option to rebuild the kernel,
which you will definitely need to do at some point, but you can do it
with an explicit `doconfig' command if you need to add extra lines to
the config file or something.

The kernel build will pick up the information that the boot monitor
put into the NVRAM.  The key here is that the following line should
have appeared in the kernel config file:
`controller msb0 at isa0 slot6 vector msbintr '

Boot your system on the new kernel.


3.  Make the msb0 device.

If it's not already there, just type `cd /dev' and `MAKEDEV msb0'.


Amsb should now work.

You can use the filterkit ans sox to accomplish this: 

http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/audio/index.html

is a good start to look for the software

# cat ~/sound.wav | kaiser 0.363356 0.85 5 | sox -r 8012 -t sw - -ul sound.au

makes a good 44.1 -> ulaw conversion.

Hello.

Has anyone else had a problem with gsm when uncompressing files
on an AXP running Digital Unix 3.2?  I've built gsm-1.0.7 and
when I attempt to uncompress files I get an error stating:


> trace untoast -cu 060694_nasa_01_ITR.au.gsm

Subject: AF error message ...
Cc: af-bugs


	Hi there,
	I am using AF ( AFR3 ) in a DEC alpha 3000/300LX running
 OSF/1 V3.2. I installed another program that uses AF for audio
 ( the program is ivs 3.5 ) and I have some problems. First ivs
 couldn't find the AF server ( Aaxp ) but that was my fault ( I
 hadn't define AUDIOFILE variable well ).
	Now ivs seems to find AF server but I get the following
 error message:

	AlibMessage (AError): A Error:  AFProtoError (2): ABadValue
	AlibMessage (MajorCode): Request Major code 24 (ARequest (24): )
	AlibMessage (MinorCode): Request Minor code 0
	AlibMessage (ResourceID): ResourceID 0x100000
	AlibMessage (ErrorSerial): Error Serial #5
	AlibMessage (CurrentSerial): Current Serial #5


	The error message comes after ivs calls procedures :

	  AFDisableOutput(ac, 1, &old, &new);
	  AFEnableOutput(ac, 2, &old, &new);

	Exactly fter calling the second one. The code for that procedure is:
void AFEnableOutput(AC ac, AMask mask, AMask *old_state, AMask *new_state)
{
    register AFAudioConn *aud = ac->connection;
    register aEnableOutputReq *req;
    aControlIOReply reply;

    LockConnection(aud);
    GetReq(EnableOutput, req);
    req->mask = mask;
    req->ac = ac->acontext;
    _AReply(aud, (aReply *) &reply, 0, aTrue);
    UnlockConnection(aud);
    SyncHandle();
    *old_state = reply.oldState;
    *new_state = reply.newState;
    return;
}

	I didn't yet debug AF but from the sources I saw that the error message
 comes from the call:
	_AReply(aud, (aReply *) &reply, 0, aTrue);

 What exactly does the error message mean ? Where ivs does wrong ?
 reply.oldState is an unsigned int but AMask is a 4 bytes word ( I think )
 so maybe we have an architecture problem ( ?? ) because Alpha is a 64bits
 architecture ?

	Any help would be appreciated !!!

			Thanks in advance,
			greetings from Crete,
				Nikos.

P.S : I send a mail to ivs list but I didn't get much help thats why I am
      sending to AF list to help me understand the problem.

	Can any one tell me how can I change the settings in
 the AF server so the voice will go only to the headphones
 and not to the speaker of the workstation ( it is very
 bad for me to want to listen to a song and not to be able
 because other people work next me ).
	I have installed AF ( release 2 and release 3 ) to
 a DEC Alpha 3000/300LX running OSF/1 v3.2 and I am using
 Aaxp server.

Aplay is pretty darned weak, as far as a sound player goes.  Are
there any good sound file players out there for AudioFile?  Or even
other audio setups?  The best I've seen so far is HP's splayer program,
but it's tied to their Aserver.  xanim isn't too bad, as far as
playing WAV files go, but that's it.

Depending on what you mean by "high-end Alphas", they probably already have
sound cards.  As far as I'm aware, all currently shipping AlphaStations
(PCI-based Alpha workstations from Digital) include Microsoft Sound Board
compatible sound cards.  

If you are talking about server systems, I don't think the sound cards have
been tested on them (although we did get a report the other day that someone
got the sound card working on a DEC 2100 4/275 server with Multimedia Services
for Digital UNIX).

If you really do need a card for your system, you can order it from Digital as
part # AVA01-AA U.S list price $155.  It includes headphones & a microphone as
well as the card itself.

DECsound, which is bundled with all Digital's Alpha workstations running
Digital UNIX or OpenVMS, is a Motif application that provides a simple tape
recorder GUI for recording, playing, and doing some simple editing of audio. It
supports Sun/NeXT .au, Microsoft WAVE, and Digital's DDIF Audio for file
formats and will play and record any sample rate or format supported by the
audio subsystem.

This is part of the Multimedia Services for Digital UNIX / OpenVMS products
which is factory installed on all workstations ordered with factory installed
software.  The OpenVMS version of the product just became available, so I'm not
sure whether the workstations are actually shipping with it yet.  If not, they
will be shortly.  The Digital UNIX product has been bundled for at least a year
now.

I have a 3000/400 running OSF/1 V3.2.  I have looked around for DECsound
and not found it.  Is it not included in OS updates?

We wrote an extension of Stefan Bading's MPEG Audio player which uses
AudioFile for playback. Currently we have two versions available, one
is the original code with our extension and the other is a part of our
project and uses interfaces of our project (e.g. to read files from
disk). The latter one can be used on any AudioFile-server on any
machine because the interface is able to up- and downsample the
output of the decoder. The first one can only downsample.

If you need more information, send me a short notice and specify what
version do you prefer.

It's factory installed with the operating system, but it's not actually part of
the operating system.  It can be found on the Layered Products CD if you
upgrade your operating system or need to reinstall it for some other reason.

Hello all;

   If this is the wrong list to send this too please accept my 
apologies,  but I really don't know whom else to ask.

Basicly I've been trying to figure out what system calls/ioctl's I have 
to do to set the volume on a DecStation and or Alpha.  I've looked around 
but could not find the sound drivers for Ultrix or OSF within their 
respective source trees,  after looking through the source to the AF lib 
all I can see is a file called SetGain.c,  but I'm not sure if this 
hasanythign to do with the volume,  and if it does I can't figure out 
exactly what it's doing/going on...... can anyone help me?

Josh

If i'm not wrog, there is an AFSetInputGain(AC ac, int gain) and an
AFSetOutputGain(). They are used for aset -outgain/-ingain # commands.

Does anybody know if it's possible for AudioFile to coexist with the MME
stuff on an alpha (under OSF/1 3.2)  (mmeserver, specifically...)?  We need
to run MME for a few things, but I'd also like to see us running AudioFile.

They can't both use the same audio device.

Since both the mmeserver and AF do mixing in the server and not in the
kernel driver, they each open the kernel driver for exclusive use. You
have to stop one and restart the other.

If you want to do audio on a device with AF and other stuff with MME,
you can remove the audio device entries in /var/mme/system.ini that
pertain to the ones you want to use exclusively with AF and then
restart MME and AF.

to whom it may concern:

	I'm currently trying to install AF version 3 release 1 (AF3R1) on a SunOS 4.1.3 SparcStation 10 with no luck.  

Tried:


	/usr/ucb/cc
	gcc  2.6.x
	gnu make

Attached is the following error message we receive during compilation.  Even during compilation with gcc and gnu make we still receive this error message.



	Thanks in advance,

	Mark

Digital research centre,

	Af has just been installed on a slc Sparc Work Station of mine. The
Sparc station is currently running Solaris 2.4 and "Asparc" server seems
to be running fine. All the clients (ahost, aplay, aset , axset etc...) have
been compiled and are executing correctly. However I am having a lot of
problems compiling the "xplay" client in the contrib/clients dir. It seems
to be a very DEC dependent program, and though I realize the "contrib" dir
is unsupported, would there be any other clients that could run on a sparc
station with the same functionality (rew, ff, play, pause buttons)? Our system
supports the tcl/tk language and thus the client "tkPlay" works fine. This
client will have to do for playing sound fro now, but a pointer to a more
advanced tcl/tk version (with ff, rew, play, pause buttons) would be much
appreciated!

Any Ideas?

Subject: AlphaStation 200 Series sound card with AF 3.x ??

We have an Alphastation 200 (OSF1 V3.0), which according to the manual is 
equipped with a sound card.

We would like to run the LBL conference tool "vat", which 
uses the AF server. It is not clear to me whether the Alphastation 200
sound card is compatible with any of the types listed in the AF release 
notes (axp , msb, j300, lofi  oor jv). The "User Information" manual has 
very little information on the card. There's a picture - it seems "F" 
shaped with 4 jacks. (as it's someone else's multitasking system I can't 
just open it up and look ;)= )

Can it be done? Without running NT to configure the card ?

Subject: Bug with errno in libAF
Reply-To: Tie.Liao@inria.fr

Hi,

I encountered a problem when using AF within a multithread package.
_ARead() and _RWrite() exited abnormally with errno EAGAIN.

It was due to a problem of errno test in AlibInt.c. When a syscall 
like read(), write() fails, some systems may return EWOULDBLOCK,
others EAGAIN. In AlibInt.c, it tests only

        (errno == EWOULDBLOCK).

On some systems, it should be like,

	(errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK).

In XlibInt.c (X11R5), the test of errno is more portable. Based
on XlibInt.c, I patched AlibInt.c, and then it works.

Attached is the patch:

I was investigating audio tools when this phrase caught my attention:
"AF does for sound what the X Windows system does for text and graphics".

We have been developing some training materials for UNIX platforms, involving
graphics and narration.  Problem is that if someone runs the course over the
network using X Windows they lose the sound (or worse - it plays on the
host workstation to the delight of whoever is sitting there).

I'm certain I can detect if the course is being run to a remote display.
If AF is indeed X Windows for sound, how do I go about routing the audio
to the remote system?  How do I know if the remote system will even support
audio (obviously an X-terminal user is out of luck).  Does the remote host
have to be configured ahead of time to accept the audio?

Has anybody done something like this?  I would like to know if it's
possible before I sink a lot of development time into it.  

Thanks in advance.

 This seems like an elementary problem, but it doesn't seem to be
 addressed in the archive of this list.  Excuse me if I just
 overlooked it.  I have built AF on an Alpha 200 4/166.  The build
 appeared to go just fine, and the Amsb server starts up without
 complaint.  However, when I attempt to play the sample sound files
 included in the kit, they sound as if they are being played at 2
 or 3 times their intended speed.  I have tried starting the server
 with the sampling rate set to 5512 (the lowest supported value)
 which seems to improve things very slightly, but not nearly enough.

 Can anyone offer any advice?

 Thank you.

Did you try aset q to see what audio sampling rate & audio encoding format
your audio hardware may accept? Maybe there is an impairment that Aserver/aplay
cann't solve.

Hope it helps,

Hello Folks,

As the AF maintainer, I would like to apologize for my lack of participation 
in this mailing list.

I have been involved full-time in activities which have very little to do with 
AF (except as a user) ever since I came to CRL. More than ever, I just cannot 
afford the time it would take to respond to the questions that come up on the 
list.

Thankfully there are others who monitor the list and offer help when they see 
fit. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY encourage this, and hope that it continues. [Special 
thanks to you folks in the DEC product groups!]

AF3R1 is reasonably mature, but there are certainly signs of wear (like the 
Solaris port). I would hope to get out a maintenance release before the end of 
the year -- but no guarentees. I will at least continue to maintain the list 
until I can find a more suitable replacement.

-Chris

Sorry to repeat myself, but I've been having problems with mail and I'm
afraid I may have missed a response.

I'm running DECAudio on a Decstation 5000 (/133).  Does anyone know of
software to send or receive FAXes?

Excuse me if I'm missing something, but how does FAX relate to audio?

Hello!
I have problems with files of AF3R1. When I am doing "make World", the process
is stopped, because, the file "Makefile" generated at ./AF/server directory,
has an error on it procedure "make Makefiles". It message is: "syntax error
at line 1 ";" unexpected". This procedure is the same procedure of the others
files "Makefile". How can I to resolve that.
I work with a Digital Alpha Axp Workstation.
Thank you!!

If I recall correctly, this problem was due to either a bug in make on
Digital UNIX (formerly DEC OSF/1) or an error in ./AF/server/Imakefile,
depending on your point of view.

In ./AF/server/Imakefile  there is a make variable ALL defined and its
definition spans two lines with the newline escaped with a '\' character.
You can work around the problem by joining these two lines in to one line
and removing the '\' character.

But, I believe this problem was corrected some time ago in the AF3R1
distribution. You might check to see if you have all the latest
patches.

I use "efax", which is a small, neat way to do direct faxes 
of text or PostScript. There is a companion program "qfax" which does some queuing 
and has a single-machine-many-users mail interface. I wrote a bit of code 
to handle MIME attachments, but audio clips were not handled 
satisfactorily ... :)=

Just a minute ... can it be that you want to generate modem tones with 
DECaudio and feed them down the phoneline ? If so, why not just buy a 
modem ?

I have the file AF3R1.tar.Z, and I obtained it at ftp address :

and I suppose, that it is the latest version.

Pardon, if I am persistant!!

I remember hearing about a proposed merge of AudioFile and the Network

Is that still in the works, dead, or was it just a bad rumor?

In reading installation instructions for AF, it says it will run
on SGI IRIX 4.0.x.  I have an Indigo 2 running IRIX 5.3 -- 
am I out of luck??  

Thanks,

Hi,
I am trying to use MBONE on ALPHA. Without an 
Audio-Server, this obviously cannot work.
Is anyone out there who has AF running on 
AlphaStation 200 4/233, or knows how to hook it up 
on this station?
Any help would be greately appreciated.
Many greetings from Vancouver,

Subject: making an Audio-CD
Cc: andi@vaw.baum.ethz.ch

Hi

I'm working on a Sun Sparc20 with a DBRI-interface.
I use AF (Asparc10 -rate 44100) to sample Audio-data into 
Audio-CD format :(nice -20 arecord -B -e PCM-16 -d 4 filename.snd).

My questions:
-------------

What are the best record options (f.e. gain? ...) to get the best 
results for generating an Audio-CD? 
(Software: CD Print, Hardware: RICOH connected to a PowerMac)

I would like to edit the soundfiles with a graphical tool. Does anyone 
know a software for handling and editing the generated fileformat? 


I would also like to know in witch format an Audio-CD is written.
And especialy the syntax of the Audio-CD track delimiter.
Or - at best - a software for generating and including those data. 
This will help me append samples to get a CD with track information.

These software I'm looking for can be for - PowerMac 8100/110 or 
                                          - Sun SunOs 4.1.3_U1 

-----------
Thanx in advance and greetings from Zuerich - Switzerland :-)

 I have spent a few hours trying to install Audiofile on an alpha
(200 4/233) running OSF/1 3.2.

 AF3R1 was not building at all (and yes, I did follow the make World
directions) and while AF3R1B built, some server files could not compile
because of /usr/sys/include/io/dec/tc/amd79c30.h (NUM_TX_BUFS undefined.)

 Has anyone run into this? Are my devices badly installed? Is this
include file a known problem?  I have chased a number of similar
problems but I am now running out of hunting energy.

 I would like a solution to this, but I prefer general reassurance that
this version is not yet working on my system and that some patience will
bring a new version that won't be as frustrating.

 I don't know if this is a guru list so I have not yet subscribed.  Please
send me responses directly.  I'll summarize if you indicate I should do so.

 Thanks in advance.

Subject: Protocol error in AF (?)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi everybody,
I just had a problem with AF running on an SGI Indy (IRIX 5.3) while
experimenting with the source code. When I try to set the encoding type
of the dda-part (server/dda/sgi) to anything higher than 3 (G721,G723 ...)
the server is running fine, but when I try to play or record samples I
get a protocol error like this :

AlibMessage (AError): A Error:  AFProtoError (2): ABadValue
  AlibMessage (MajorCode): Request Major code 4 (ARequest (4): )
  AlibMessage (MinorCode): Request Minor code 0
  AlibMessage (ResourceID): ResourceID 0x100000
  AlibMessage (ErrorSerial): Error Serial #1
  AlibMessage (CurrentSerial): Current Serial #2

I suspect that there is a problem with one of the fields in the requests
(not allowing certain values) but I have no idea how to solve it.
Anybody else had this problem before or is there a patch I might have
missed ? I'm using AF3R1 so I thought I have all current patches in there.
Another thing : There are quite a lot of different encoding types, but all
of the drivers I looked at only use the first ones. Is there any driver
actually using one of the other types ?
And the last one : Anybody added any encoding types to the list and had
success ?

Any help, comments, tips will be appreciated
					Matthias

P.S.: I sent the above problem to af-bugs@crl.dec.com a while ago but I
didn't get any response. Is the list not active any more or are you
just to busy at the moment ?

Subject: Turning off internal speaker on a DEC3000?

We've got a network of DEC3000's running OSF/1. We use AudioFile with
Aaxp to play sounds, and have been very happy with it so far.

Unfortunately, the internal speakers of these beasts are not terribly
high quality. They do have the headset sockets in the back, but when
these are used the sound still comes out of the internal speaker,
irritating everyone in the lab as well as the person who's using it.

Is there any way of turning off the internal speaker and routing sound
directly to the headset? I've had a look at the (lack of)
documentation, and even done some source-groping, but I've found one
reference to the output device (outSel in the dda/axp server
directory). This doesn't appear to be used anyway. All the relevant
programs insist I've only got one output device. Turning this off stops
all sound output.

Does anyone know how to do this?

Hello,

we use AF on a DEC 3000/800 for a year (Aaxp) with no problem. Now we
bought an AlphaStation 250 4/266 with the Microsoft Sound Board.
I tried to set up the Amsb Server (which was designed for the Jensen with
the msb-Board). The result is that the Server alway tells me that the device
(/dev/msb0, which exists) is busy.
What can I do to run AF on our AlphaStation? Do I have to include/exclude
some drivers into the kernel (msb.o) ?

Any idea? 


Joerg.

All new systems ship with Multimedia Services for Digital UNIX installed,
so you probably have an mmeserver process which has the MSB device open.
You can stop the server using the command

	/sbin/init.d/mmeserver stop

If you want to run the multimedia server for other functions, but not have
it grab the MSB, you can edit /var/mme/system.ini and remove the following line:

	wave=libmsb.so

Subject: What is this, and how do I work it?

We've got a DEC 3000 workstation with an extra sound card. The sound
card is connected to an external break-out box by a monstrously thick
50-way cable. Nobody knows what this thing is, except for vague
memories of somebody using it to play CD-quality sound. It doesn't have
any labels on it apart from `DECaudio' on the front and the usual
excitingly chunky DEC case.

On the front it's got earphone and microphone jacks, a socket for a DEC
headset, a small pushbutton, and two volume controls. On the back it's
got phono plugs for line in and speakers, an ISDN socket, a D connector
marked DSP, a pushbutton which apparently enables the DSP socket, and a
few other connectors.

Does anyone know what this thing is, how to make it go, and whether
there's an AudioFile server for it? We're currently limited to playing
sounds through the standard internal speakers, which are mediocre at
best, and nobody knows how to turn them off so that we can play through
something decent. It seems a pity to have this piece of hardware
sitting in a corner doing nothing.

The machine with this thing runs OSF/1, and we've tried all the
standard AudioFile servers, without success, but that could be because
we don't know how to configure it properly.

Any help anyone can offer would be gratefully appreciated...

You can use the Alofi server, but you need to load device driver first.

The driver is found in the AF3R1 distribution.  To install it, as root, cd
to ./devices/lofi/driver/alpha.kit/output and install it with the command
    # setld -l .

This procedure will require rebuilding the kernel and rebooting.  I may say
that you need to create the /dev/lofi0 device but I believe that is not
true, the device will get created for you, but you will need to create the
symbolic link /dev/lofi -> lofi0.

In spite of the name "Lofi" this DECaudio device does have stereo CD-quality
capability.  Note, however, that the device and the device driver on the
Alpha machines are unsupported.

Howdy,

Does anyone know where I can get other AF clients?
One I am particularly after is abiff.

Subject: AF doesnt work on DEC 3000 AXP model 600

This may or may not be a bug....

I have compiled AF3R1 on a DEC ALPHA running Digital UNIX 3.2c
 
I use Aaxp to access the bba audio device

It works fine on a model 300 AND a model 300LX
the PROBLEM is that it will not work on our model 600

The only difference I can find is that the bba is defined on slot
5 on the model 300's and is defined on slot 7 on the model 600

What have I run across? Or am I just blind to what I need to do to
get this to work.

TIA and for your time and assistance.

Don

If you can give a bit more detail about error messages 
you get, it would help track down the problem. Is Aaxp 
starting or not, and what errors do you get.

Aaxp works fine on a DEC 3000-600 here, runnning UNIX 
V3.2c. My binaries were compiled at a V2.0 system and 
the same binary works with a 3000-500. I ex no problems 
there.

Have you checked on the existence of a running 
mmeserver on the 3000-600? They use the same ports and 
cannot run together. If it does, run as root 

# /usr/bin/mmeserver stop and try your Aaxp again.

Subject: AF on SPARC10 running Solaris 2.5
Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 21:25:27 -0500
From: joel boutros <nihilis@moral.addiction.com>

so, i've got this Solaris 2.5 implementation running on a SPARC10 with the
speaker box.  and i ftp'd, checked patches for application (none), and
compiled it.

It compiled.  Yay!

I started up the server (i've used both, for reference purposes, and from
which I'm cut/pasting, i'm using Asparc).

and i get this.

current envionment, with mostly relevant settings only (i'm confident my
TERMCAP won't bugger it)

HOSTTYPE=sparc
PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/etc:/opt/staff/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/X11R6/bin
STY=414.pts-2.moral
OSTYPE=SunOS5

my invocation of Asparc is simply that:  'Asparc &'

my invocation of aplay (for that test it mentions in the install
documentation) is as follows:

[874]moral:/opt/AF3R1/bin# ./aplay /u/s/nihilis/au/bush.au
./aplay: can't open connection.
[875]moral:/opt/AF3R1/bin# ./aplay -server localhost:0 /u/s/nihilis/au/bush.au
Alib:  connection to "localhost:0.0" refused by server
Alib:  Client is not authorized to connect to Server
./aplay: can't open connection.
[876]moral:/opt/AF3R1/bin# ./ahost
./ahost:  unable to open audio server ""
[877]moral:/opt/AF3R1/bin# ./ahost +
./ahost:  unable to open audio server ""

no .Xauthority files.  no /etc/AF*.hosts files (i couldn't find
documentation anywhere).

now, the fun thing is...

[880]moral:/opt/AF3R1/bin# truss -t open ./ahost
open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY)                     = 3
open("/usr/lib/libsocket.so.1", O_RDONLY)       = 4
open("/usr/lib/libnsl.so.1", O_RDONLY)          = 4
open("/usr/lib/libc.so.1", O_RDONLY)            = 4
open("/usr/lib/libdl.so.1", O_RDONLY)           = 4
open("/usr/lib/libintl.so.1", O_RDONLY)         = 4
open("/usr/lib/libmp.so.1", O_RDONLY)           = 4
open("/usr/lib/libw.so.1", O_RDONLY)            = 4
open("/usr/platform/SUNW,SPARCstation-10/lib/libc_psr.so.1", O_RDONLY) Err#2
ENOENT
./ahost:  unable to open audio server ""

what's that libc_psr.so.1?  the only thing i can find with that name (or
much close that's a library at all) on my Solaris 2.5 media (grepping all
the pkgmap files) is for UltraSPARC.  does this file actually exist
anywhere, and/or is it used by AF?  is it loaded by a dependency? 
everything i see claims it for processor information.

would it not finding this library cause it to exit?  the only thing between
it failing to find it with ahost and it displaying that it can't open the
connection to the server (which does find timing miscalibrations; it
produces logs of that anyway) is a munmap() call.

/tmp/.AF-unix/AF0 (pipe) is perm'd 000.  my umask is 077, though, so i can
see how that would be true.  even when setting it perm 666, ahost(1) still
fails a connection (no DISPLAY environmental variable; no AUDIOFILE
variable) in the same manner.

other programs (aplay, for instance) do manage to open /dev/tcp.  they don't
manage to actually connect.

i'm lost.  has anyone else encountered this?  does anyone else know why it
might come up with this one?. .. i'd love to at some point (after writing
stuff that my job wants me to write), in a lull period, write The World's
Best Audio Suite (wouldn't we all?.. okay, well, wouldn't a lot of us? ..
okay.  wouldn't one of you out there like to do this, besides me?), but if i
can't get the underlying stuff working, i can't get the program written
either.

also, i'm not sure how dependent it is upon it, but Project/AF/config/sun.cf
is dated SunOS 5.2.  I changed it to 5.5 and it didn't build Asparc10.  I
left it the way it was, and it liked it.  Maybe something there.  Or, maybe
not, since I changed some other stuff and then, finding a lack of said
server, blew up the source tree and restarted without changing anything I
wasn't Just Sure Of.

Ideas anyone?

- Joel

I don't know what libc_psr.so.1 is either, but the AF version we have
on our Solaris 2.5 Sparcs works OK even though it gets the same open
error as you:

  % truss -t open ahost
    ...
  open("/usr/platform/sun4m/lib/libc_psr.so.1", O_RDONLY) Err#2 ENOENT
    ...

So this may not be the reason why your version does not work.  We
compiled it with gcc back on Solaris 2.4.  It's also an old version of
AF, AF2R2-P25, so my comments may not apply to your setup.

   These responses are due to no AUDIOFILE or DISPLAY variables being set.
   The second try at aplay (using -server) would have worked if ahost had
   been properly executed first.  Try setting AUDIOFILE to localhost:0
   (or wherever the audio server is running), then run ahost, then try
   aplay or other clients.

   No.  This is a red herring and has nothing to do with your problems.

>see how that would be true.  even when setting it perm 666, ahost(1) still

   Set the AUDIOFILE environment variable and everything will be happy :-).

   The AudioFile port was done for SunOS 5.2 and has not been tested or
   upgraded for 5.5 .  It will probably work as is.

it did turn out to be AUDIOFILE, yes, but it was ':0' rather than
'localhost:0' or, apparently, it allows the onboard interface address (in
this case, 206.0.7.6) to go through, but not localhost (someone said it was
broken, but was supposed to).

based on that i got it working.

yep, it does. *grin*

Hi,

have anybody used Tek. XP400 X terminals with audio extention which is an AF3R1 compliant
implementation of Audio File server? 
I have a strage problem while running AF clients on a DEC Alpha  that address this AF server:
1. I call it with a client (say "aplay") it works fine
2. I call it with a second (say "aset " to set the volume louder) while the first is still
running, my AF server dies with a fatal error: task not implemented 
This error is not related to the type of client but to the fact that another client
calls the server.

Tektronix "marked" the bug but their technical support said they cann't reproduce it
because they don't have the same environment as mine. In the same time they affirm
their implementation is an AF3R1.

I'm running AF3R1 on different DECs and I never have this problem when using AFserver
and different clients on the same DEC machine.

Anybody has any idea?

Thanks,

I've just upgraded a couple machines to DU 3.2D-1 and now find that
Audio File no longer works.  When trying to run the server Aaxp, it
reports

    dda can't open /dev/streams/bba, errno message " 2 "

There is no /dev/streams/bba.  I would just try and create the device,
but don't know what major,minor numbers to use.  The old numbers seem
to have all been remapped in this release.  I do have the following in
my kernel definition

    controller      bba0    at *   vector bbaintr

and see this when booting

This particular machine is a 3000/700, but I assume 3000/500 and 3000/600
will be the same.  Note that I have never been able to get AF to work on
any of our AlphaStations.

How do I get AF working under 3.2D?

Jim,

here are the details for 'my' bba device (on a DEC 3000/600). The Alphaaservers and 
Alphastations have the microsoft sound board and do not use the bba device. I do not 
have experience with getting that soundboard to work with AudioFile. The Multimedia 
Services for Digital UNIX, packaged with your system should work though and provide 
good sound facilities.

That might be stretching it.  I have MME 2.0 loaded and while it's much
better than the previous version there are still some problems.  Notably,
I often get what appears to be ``feedback'' on my AlphaStation 200 with the
Microsoft sound board.  It's pretty unpredictable, and pretty annoying.

I figured it out shortly after posting.  At boot time, /sbin/rc2.d/S35streams
calls "/usr/sbin/strsetup -i".  This is supposed to build all the stream
devices on every reboot.  I had rebooted many times since upgrading, so
this should have been in place.  But I ran it anyway and it created the
bba device.  I have no idea why it failed to create the device until then.

I presume that the major,minor numbers for the /dev/streams devices depend
on your particular kernel and not on the version of the operating system.
I've had a number of different values reported.

I also looked at MME 2.0.  It is much improved over previous versions,
but still not perfect.  Since I've had trouble with AF on AlphaStation 200
and 250 machines, and have only gotten core dumps on AS 600's, I'll give
MME a try for a while and see how it feels.  I get the sense that development
on AF was abandoned many moons ago.

We have a problem which I wonder if any of you can solve. We need to be able to 
run adpcm and pitch shifting code in our audio file software on the J300 turbo 
channel board. The audio is compressed as 16 kbit/s adpcm and at the moment we 
compress it on the Alpha workstation and then play it back through the J300 
card. This uses up too much CPU time. The question is can we use the DSP chip on 
the J300 card to to the work for us? Is there a development kit or API we can 
use?

(apologies to the other people on this list that already know this)

Sheesh! You would think people would know better by now, but
noooo. If you want to get off this list, try sending mail to
af-request@crl.dec.com, not to the list itself. It's a fairly
well-defined convention for electronic mailing lists.

Once again, if you want to get off this list, try sending your unsubscribe
request to
   af-request@crl.dec.com

And if you send mail to me asking me to unsubscribe you, I will point
and laugh.

Anthony, just a subscriber.

Subject: Inputs on Microsoft sound cards
X-Shipping: Southeast veering south 3 or 4. fair. moderate or good

I'm trying to record via the (admittedly cheap looking) black desktop
microphone and the Microsoft (compatible) sound board in an
Alphastation running OSF and AF.  AF is working fine - we use it to
play things back all the time.

The main problem is that the recordings are at such low level, and I
believe this is because the microphone gain is not set high enough.
Again, AF seems to work when I try to increase the input gain - I just
dont understand how the card itself is meant to work.  It seems to
have two mono channels and one stereo channel, but they are connected
in some way which isn't at all obvious.

My point is that if I understood what the card was capable of, it
would be trivial to use AF to configure it to use the correct gain on
the correct channels.  Could anyone point me to some documentation of
any kind?

Phil Garner.

Hi,

We are looking for a sort of audio window manager. We would like the user
to be able to choose which client is receiving input (speech), and
we need to get info about currently attached clients.

Are there hooks in the server that would allow us to do this?
Does any 'audio window managers' exist?

Thanks,

Not that I know of.  An "Audio Manager" is among the requirements for
the X Consortium's "X Audio System" project (a.k.a. "Common Audio" or
"Broadway Audio System").  But in the first release the Audio Manager
may or may not have the capabilities you describe.

What's the status of this common audio project now?  I've read about it two 
years ago.

Hello members and friends,

Please forgive the intrusion into your e-mail, but the future of the
Global Blind exchange (GBX) may lie in your hands.  This is not a
solicitation, it will cost you nothing, and only requires a few seconds
of your time.

GBX has enjoyed phenomenal growth and expansion over its first few
months of operation.  We connect to over 1000 members in over 19
countries, and we have immediate plans for expanding our services
which include a new type of Internet connection that will provide up
to 18 users simultaneously.

GBX is requesting outside sponsorship from organizations, agencies
serving the blind, and companies who recognize the advantages that
GBX provides, and can provide, on the Internet.  This request,
however, is best facilitated with a show of support from its own
membership in the form of a petition, and this is what we ask of you.

If you use GBX and enjoy any of its features or services, we are
asking you to simply respond to this e-mail message directly to the
GBX Administration at admin@gbx.org.  Your name will be compiled
on a list to show prospective sponsors the size and breadth of the
GBX membership; We will not sell or donate this list to anyone, and
we need a direct response as an authorization to add your name to the
list.

We only ask that you respond to this message directly or send a
message to us with the word 'yes' in addition to your city and State. 
If you have time, and you are willing to indulge us, we suggest that
you also add a short comment on what you like best on GBX, and
what features or services you would like us to provide in the future. 
We would greatly appreciate this latter suggestion as we wish GBX to
address the most needs of our members, but it is not necessary.

Again, we apologize for the intrusion, and we thank you in advance
for your support and consideration.

Subject: AF on linux?

Hi, I sent this letter out a couple of weeks ago, but apparently it didn't go through to the list. I am trying to get the ENO sound extension for AF working under linux. I found Mark Chapman's port of AF to FreeBSD but haven't yet succeeded in making it work for linux. Has anyone else tried and succeeded? 

Thanks,

jasons@cs.unm.edu

Yes, I succeeded in getting a version of the FreeBSD port to compile
under linux. It has no device level support, but the basic AF
functionality exists.

I haven't had time to clean it up, but there is a binary available via
anonymous ftp from:

cayenne.lcs.mit.edu

located in /pub/AF/AF3R1-pc-i486-linux1.2.tar.Z

There is also an ELF binary
AF3R1-pc-i386-linux-elf.tar.gz

this was done more recently by someone else in the group and may be more
complete...


If you are looking to build the system yourself, the main problem with
the BSD distribution is that it using a POSIX compliant make which
chokes under linux. I using the normal linux make, and with a few
changes it compiled easily. I believe there is a pmake for linux that
might also work, but I haven't explored this.

I would appreciate any feedback that you might have.

Good Luck!

Hey all,

I've started keeping a hypermail archive of this list so that it can
be read from the web. It's at:

http://www.cs.unm.edu/~jasons/AF/index.html

I made an archive of the old list as well:

Hope it's useful to others.

To set the record straight:

A few weeks back there was some talk about Digital's Multimedia Services,
and I made a somewhat disparaging comment about it because of problems that 
I had encountered with it (and only it).  I had complained about ``feedback'' 
that would often (but not always) occur when using MME apps such as decsound.
I didn't ever encounter the feedback when using other apps that use the sound 
board (even apps using the MME libraries worked OK).  At that time no one else
in my group had MME installed, so I didn't have anything to compare my
machine's behavior with.

I got email shortly thereafter from Tom Morris of Digital's `Light and 
Sound Engineering' group (sounds like a cool job!).  He indicated that he had
never encountered such a problem with MME and suggested I may have a hardware
problem with the sound board in my AlphaStation 200.

I've since had the Microsoft Sound Board replaced, and I'm happy to say that
Tom was completely correct -- it was a hardware problem.  Decsound no longer
``whines'', and I'm now very happy with Digital's MME.  AF is still interesting
to me, but MME currently is (IMHO) a much more polished set of utilities for 
anyone with an AlphaStation.

Thanks again to Tom!

Tim

Subject: relative time in AF

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi, now for our regularily scheduled program. I am using the ENO
extension for AF in order to add sounds to user
interfaces. Apparently, the reason things have been working slowly for
me is due to AF's absolute sense of time. In a user interface, I want
to have an action trigger a sound, immediately. If AF gets a request
in the past, it will discard it, and hence there seems to be no way to
say the equivalent of "play it as soon as possible".

Is this really true? Am I forced to have some un-natural time padding,
say 200ms, just to guaruntee that AF will play the sound?

This seems impossible, so I would really appreciate someone telling me
what I'm missing.

Thanks,
jas.

Hi,

I've been using AudioFile for a variety of applications, but I'm running
into a sporadic problem. Every so often, one of my apps dies with:

Alib:  warning, client built for newer rev (3) than server (0)!
Alib:  connection to "tucson:0.0" refused by server
Alib:  
Can't open connection to audio server.

The app will work fine maybe ten times then fail the 11th.
If I just rerun it, it's ok. I don't need to restart the server process.

I'm doing this on a Sparc20 under solaris, server: Asparc

Any help would be greatly appriciated.

I'm having trouble getting the msb driver that comes with AF to install
properly on my system. I get a bunch of errors wehn I try to recompile
the kernel. I've seen a few mentions of a different driver form MME, but
I don't have the layered products CD. Is there anywhere else that can
get the driver from? Or are there any other solutions?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Dear Sirs:

	HELP!!!!! We are a group of  90 dedicated, hard working musicians at
Hammonton High School in Hammonton, New Jersey.  Our band director, Mr. Paul
Enuco, and our choral director, Mr. Charles Paul have a dream.  The music
department
this year has the most talented seniors ever in the history of the high
school music
program.  The selection chosen for this year's band show is "Laudate Dominum", a
musical piece with its roots deep in British history.  Our dream is to
perform this piece in
England in the spring.  To do this, we must raise close to $60,000, as we
make every
effort to defray the cost of the trip for each and every band member.  Fund
raising is a
necessity, and we have planned many fund raisers for the coming year.  We
are selling
funnel cakes at the local carnival as well as newspaper subscriptions,
cookbooks and
candy.  We hold spaghetti dinners, hoagie sales, and art auctions.   We host
a band
competition, which raises close to $10,000 each year.  However, we know we
will still
need more.  

	That is why we are asking you if you can help us.  We will be willing to
advertise
your contribution to this worthwhile effort.  We know you must be asked to
contribute to
a variety of causes, but we are a small high school with a big dream.
Please help us to
make this happen!!

	You may contact Mr. Paul Enuco or Mr. Charles Paul at Hammonton High
School, (609) 567-7000 for verification.

	Thank you in advance from all of the members of the Hammonton High School
Marching Unit and myself,

						Senior Saxophone Player

Hi,

I'm having a problem using threads with AudioFile.

My goal is to be able to play multiple sound files simultaneously from one
program using threads whose only purpose are to call AFPlaySamples with the
proper parameters for each sound.  I'm not calling AFPlaySamples from anywhere
but within these threads.

My program works for the first thread that's created and fails when I call
AFPlaySamples from a second thread.

Is it possible to do what I'm trying to do?  It seems to me as if AudioFile will
not accept multiple calls to AFPlaySamples from the same process.  If, for
example, I run two copies of my program simultaneously under two different
processes, I am able to play two different sounds (one thread per process).  The
problem occurs when I try to play more than one sound under one process.

Any help you can give me is GREATLY appreciated!

Thanks!

As far as I know, libAF never made any claims to be thread-safe.  Since it's
based on X11R4 libX11 which definitely was _not_ thread-safe, it is very
likely that libAF is not thread-safe either.

Only certain specific libraries on Digital Unix are threadsafe.  I understand 
AudioFile is not a Digital product and I am not familiar with it, but unless its 
documentation says it's threadsafe I would not expect it to work reliably from 
concurrent threads.  Sometimes it is possible to use an otherwise unsafe library 
by creating a mutex in the application and bracketing all calls into the libary 
in question with a mutex-lock/mutex-unlock pair.

Subject: DecTalk API problem (bug?)

hi, 
I'm using DECTalk software ver. 4.2, and the following function call
causes core dump:
  
  int devNo = 0;
  long devOptions = DO_NOT_USE_AUDIO_DEVICE;
  LPTTS_HANDLE_T ttsHandle;

  TextToSpeechStartup( &ttsHandle, devNo, devOptions, NULL, NULL );

And if I change devOptions to OUTPUT_TO_MME_DEVICE, there'll be no 
core dump at least. The API manual says it should be ok in either case.
Can anyone give me a hint?  TIA.
And please reply directly to me for I'm not in this mailing list.

Hi all,

I'm not sure if this list is still a going thing.  My last recorded
message was over one year ago.  Anyway, we recently upgraded to sparc 20s
for our telecommunications network management system and so I upgraded
from AF R2 to R3 to support audio on the new sparcs .  All went well
with the upgrade.

However, by looking at the code for server/dda/sparc10/sparc.c, I noticed
a potential error. I enclose below a patch for patchlevel 11.

By the way, what ever came of the merger between AF and Netaudio?

thanks for the reply.
yes, i'd love to get some more info 
on the MSB device driver.

something i didn't mention that i thought
i'd post to the list.  

i also have a couple of AlphaStation 400's
that have the MSB installed as an ISA card.

the 255 and the 500 have the sound stuff
ON the motherboard.  so, what i'm guessing
is that the MSB device driver is mis-handling
this "MSB-compatible" device on the newer
Alpha's motherboards.

can anyone point me to somewhere where i 
can get more info on the hardware?

HI !!   This is a great deal on prepaid phone cards.   feel free to pass
it on to your friends.   The "Flag"   phone card will let you talk to any
one at 25 cents per domestic minute. This is not as cheap as E-mail , but
is nice to hear a voice on occasion.. 
send a check for ten dollars and you will receive a 40 minute phone card.
please include a self-addressed envelope , I will stamp it. and I will
include an extra stamp to reimburse you for the stamp you use to mail to
me.   If you use phone cards you proably know that  40 minutes for 10
dollar card is not your  common over the counter deal.  I have very
little overhead. If your interested in several cards you can contact me
at this E-mail address to arrange a discount.

Please  mail  your order to :              Jim Lepper

YOU MAY BE PAYING TOO MUCH AND GETTING TOO LITTLE!!!

NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!   http://www.netcenter.com

Hi, my name is Mike Mathiesen.  I wrote the book, "Marketing on the Internet", so please believe what I'm going to tell you.  You may be making money from your website, but you could be making TEN TIMES as much if you join my network-marketing opportunity I'm going to tell you about here.

1st, I DISCOVERED THIS SECRET after years of ONLINE research.  You have to ask yourself, "What is it that people coming to your website want and need more than anything else?"  The answer I discovered is: they want BETTER, MORE RELIABLE Internet Access and they want to EARN MONTHLY ROYALTIES by referring their friends, because they know that the Internet going to be in EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE WORLD. 

That's why I started Internet Access for Webmasters like you.  You can make more money than you dreamed possible, simply by putting up a link from your WebSite to ours.  When they switch their Internet Provider to us, we PAY YOU a handsome royalty forever.  You, in fact, have a chance to earn tens of thousands of dollars simply because you're a website owner.  And later, as you get to know me, you'll find that I have dozens more ways for you to make EVEN BIGGER rewards.  

We're the largest Internet Access Provider who also usess NETWORK-MARKETING as their main marketing plan.  Just get a few people per month from your website and they'll in turn get a few of their friends, and so on, until you have thousands in your downline.  It's already happening to many of us in the company.  We launched just a couple months ago, and already have over 2,000 members.  

We want you to join us.  We'll teach you how you can use your website talents to make far more money than you are now.  It's became so obvious to me a few months ago.  Everyone visiting a website has to have Internet Access.  Why not let them get their access through me, or YOU?

Now, we can offer this to you and pay you royalties of UP TO $5.O0/MO for each user you get to switch their access provider to ours.  BUT WAIT, there's so much more.  You can earn up to $1,000 on a computer lease when your web browsers lease a computer FROM YOU.  You earn money when they use our Long Distance, or when they use our EZSiteMaker or our EZAutoresponders, or our Satellite Dish Network, or our WEBTV Clone.  We have dozens of services coming that will each pay you a handsome commission and/or MONTHLY ROYALTIES, all because you have a website and therefore you have website visitors.

WE EVEN HAVE AN INSTANT DOWNLINE BUILDER FOR YOU.  We use the Internet to its highest and best use.

If you know how recruit people into Network-Marketing Plans, you are going to be hugely successful following my BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS.   Network Marketing, combined with the right product, combined with my marketing techniques developed over the last 3 years can MAKE YOU A GUZZILLIONAIRE.  Please make no mistake about that.

As you know, most webmasters don't make a profit.   NOW, you can make a HUGE PROFIT as an Internet Access Provider.  And if you join us today, I'll also toss in a copy of my new book, "How to Get your WebSite in the TOP 10 Search Results on all the major Search Engines," absolutely Free, when you join.  

The tips in this book alone are worth more than the modest entry fee to join us.  With this information you can double or triple or even quintuple the number of visitors to your website.  Couple this information with the program we will have for you that captures their Email Addresses of each and every visitor, the FREE INSTANT DOWNLINE BUILDER and you can see that you can be on your way to financial Success.  

THE FIRST STEP is to take a look at our WebSite and see for yourself why 1st Family is rapidly becoming a Major Player in Internet Access Providers.  We have global coverage.  We have dial-ups in all major cities of the world.  AND NOW, you can be part of it all.  We have many webmasters already earning thousands per month simply by telling their visitors about a way to get their Internet Access for FREE and actually make money as a distributor.

YOUR NEXT STEP TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM IS TO VISIT OUR WEBSITE.  

http://www.netcenter.com

I WILL TEACH YOU how to make SERIOUIS MONEY with your website. (If you already make Serious Money, this will make you EXTREMELY SERIOUS!)

Subject: Your Website's Findability

Would you like to improve your website's 
"findability" in the Search Engines?

During the past year, my company has placed over 100 
webpages into the Top Ten -- the front page -- of the 
major search engines... and, for a small fee, I am 
willing to show you exactly how we did it.

My name is Stephen Mahaney. I am the president of 
Planet Ocean Communications. My web marketing company 
has literally "written the book" on how to position your 
website on the front page -- the Top Ten -- of each of 
the major search engines... guaranteed!

Our 45 page book identifies every trick & technique that 
is being used on the Internet to gain an almost "unfair" 
advantage in landing websites at the top of the search 
engine lists -- right where you need to be so that 
potential customers who are seeking your services or 
products can find you.

Our monthly Newsletter keeps you abreast of the latest 
techniques and frequent changes that take place in the 
dynamic world of "search engine" science.

However, understanding the process does not require 
a degree in "rocket" science -- nor do you need to be 
"technically oriented". Whether your website is a 
"do-it-yourself" project or you are paying someone 
to maintain your site, you (or your webmaster) need 
to know the tricks in this book in order to compete with 
the professionals who are dominating the front pages of 
the various search categories.

To learn more about how you can obtain this essential 
information and receive a free subscription to our 
Newsletter -- SEARCH ENGINE SECRETS UPDATE, 
go to....

You'll be glad you did.

Sincerely,
Stephen Mahaney - President
Planet Ocean Communications
