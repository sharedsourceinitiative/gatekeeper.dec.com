                GETTING STARTED ON BUILDING UNIX PINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Note: source code for PC-Pine is not currently available.)

After downloading one of the compressed "tar" files (pine.tar.gz, _or_
pine.tar.bz2, _or_ pine.tar.Z) here are the steps to build Unix
Pine (and the other related programs):

Step 1: Uncompress the downloaded file:

        uncompress pine.tar.Z
   or
        gunzip pine.tar.gz
   or
        bunzip2 pine.tar.bz2
        
Step 2: Extract files from the "tar" archive:

        tar xf pine.tar

Step 3: Change directory to the extracted pineX.XX directory, e.g.

        cd pine4.62

Step 4: Read the distribution's README file for detailed instructions:
