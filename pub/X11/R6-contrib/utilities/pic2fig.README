NAME
     pic2fig - Fig preprocessor for drawing simple pictures

SYNOPSIS
     pic2fig _f_i_l_e

DESCRIPTION
     _P_i_c_2_f_i_g is a _F_i_g(_l) preprocessor for drawing simple  figures
     in  Fig  code.  The basic objects are _b_o_x, _l_i_n_e, _a_r_r_o_w, _c_i_r_-
     _c_l_e, _e_l_l_i_p_s_e, _a_r_c and text.

     When _p_i_c_2_f_i_g is executed, it produces an output file in  the
     current  directory.   The name is constructed from the input
     file's name.  If the input filename  ends  with  .pic,  then
     that extension will be replaced by .fig.  Otherwise, .fig is
     appended to the input filename.  If  _f_i_l_e  does  not  exist,
     then _p_i_c_2_f_i_g tries appending .pic to the name.

     The input language for _p_i_c_2_f_i_g is identical to that for _p_i_c,
     which  is  used with _d_t_r_o_f_f(_l), except for extensions listed
     below.   Things  enclosed  within  .PS  and  .PE   will   be
     translated  by _p_i_c_2_f_i_g to _F_i_g intermediate code which can be
     further translated into a  number  of  graphics  description
     languages.  Text not within .PS and .PE will be passed unal-
     tered to the output file.  The  default  line  thickness  of
     drawings  is  8 milli-inches.  You may adjust this using the
     command:

          .ps _n

     for _n milli-inches.  This command must be given in the first
     column.   Changing  the  drawing thickness applies to solid,
     dashed, and dotted lines, as  well  as  circles,  arcs,  and
     ellipses.

     Normally, the distance between text is 12 points.  If you're
     using larger text to label objects, this should be set to an
     appropriate larger value.  This can be done using the

          .baseline _n

     command, where _n is any  real  value,  whose  units  are  in
     typesetter points.

     The shading texture may be controlled with the command:

          .tx _N _w_1 _w_2 ... _w_N

     where the _w_N are 32-bit integers expressed  in  hexadecimal.
     This command must be given in the first column.

     Other input lines which begin with a  period  character  are
     passed  through to the output unaltered except for stripping
     the initial period character.  It is  recommended  that  you
     not  use  this  feature  unless  you really know what you're
     doing.

     Extensions and differences: Text in _p_i_c_2_f_i_g can be any arbi-
     trary TeX text.  It is set in restricted horizontal mode.

     Boxes, circles, and ellipses may  have  two  attributes  not
     available  in  _p_i_c:  they  may  be  ``shaded'' or ``white''.
     Because of restrictions in the current Imagen postprocessor,
     objects may not be given other attributes (eg, ``dashed'' or
     ``invis'') if they are ``shaded'' or ``white'' for that out-
     put  device.   Shaded  figures are grayed in their interior.
     White objects force their interior to be whitened if it  was
     shaded  by  another object.  Objects are ``stacked'' on each
     other in the order in which they are defined in the  _p_i_c_2_f_i_g
     input  file.  The shading attributes are subject to restric-
     tions of the capabilities of the output device used.
