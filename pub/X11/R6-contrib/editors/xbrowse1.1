                         xbrowse 1.1
               
              
  This is a minor update of the original version of xbrowse.
  (Created by Stephan Jackson.)

  Added support for editres and resource files. 
  
  You can now use editres to get a resource heirarchy of
  widgets and classes.
  
  The toplevel class (which was unnamed in the original)
  has been named "Browse", so you can now have a default
  or user resource file named  "Browse".
  
  I've include my own resource file in the tar archive.
  It works well on Sparc 2's with color monitors.  
  
  A small note on the scrollbar resource:  Since this is a
  motif application which uses the ScrolledWindow widget,
  you cannot set the scrollbar background independently of
  the text background :( at least, not with my version of Motif).
