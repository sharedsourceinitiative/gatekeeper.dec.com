This is a short bibliography of X books published by O'Reilly &
Associates.  It is intended to supplement Ken Lee's X bibliography,
which does not list authors or ISBN numbers for these books.  Since I
write for O'Reilly & Associates, I have not attempted to review the
books here, but have just given short descriptions of the books,
sometimes copying text from the back cover.
