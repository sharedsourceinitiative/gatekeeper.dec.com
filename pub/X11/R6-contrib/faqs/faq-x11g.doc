Spy vs Bob
==========

In svb, you control the Spy (Pink) who is trying to escape the building. The 
"BoB"s in the elevators are trying to stop you. The goal is to get across the  
screen without being smashed by a "BoB" before time runs out. Any leftover 
time is added to your score as a bonus. The "BoB"s will change speed each time 
they change direction. On each ledge some "SLACK" will appear after a random 
delay. Picking this up is worth 500 bonus points.

each coordinating a complete army, players at the opposite position of the
playing board are allied. The goal of the game is to capture the COLOURS of
the enemy.

the board, and attacks the armies of other players until a certain mission 
(chosen by the computer) is accomplished, or until the world is totally 
conquered. Xrisk might be played with 1 or 2 active players.

take "turns", they all issue their commands simultaneously. There can be 
any number of players, and each player is assigned to a color team (or black, 
white & gray for monochrome monitors). The game board is a matrix of squares 
that can be occupied by colored troops, and the aim of the game is to 
eliminate the enemy from the board by attacking squares occupied enemy troops.
