NAME: TimeTracker
AUTHOR: Harald Tveit Alvestrand, UNINETT <harald.t.alvestrand@uninett.no>
COPYRIGHT: Yes

TimeTracker is an Athena Widget-based program to keep track of time.
It puts up a list of projects, and the number of minutes worked on each.
You click on the project you want to work on, and it starts counting on that.
At the end of the day, it saves the collected data in a file, and you can
use a script to process the data. "sumtitra" is one possible such script.

There are a couple of man pages floating around.

Whatever you do about it, please tell me.

NOTE: This program used to be called Timex. Timex is a registered trade mark
of the Timex corporation; they did not like to have something that had their
name on it, but was neither owned nor controlled by them.

An updated version of this page is on the World Wide Web
at http://domen.uninett.no/~hta/titra/TimeTracker.html

INSTALLATION

If you are lucky:

1) Unshar/untar the software. It untars into the current directory.

2) Inspect the imakefile. You may want to change NONXBINDIR and PERLLIBDIR.

3) % xmkmf
   This creates a makefile configured for *your* system.
   I'm almost certain the included one will bite you.

4) % make

5) % make test
   This takes TimeTracker for a "test ride", using the directory "test.TimeTracker"
   in the current directory.

6) (as root) # make install

7) % titrax

If you are unlucky, mumble.
If you find out why you are unlucky, send me an E-mail about it.

Tested on a lot of platforms, thanks to the beta test corps (you know
who you are, THANKS!):

- Sun3/SunOS
- Sun4/SunOS
- SCO Unix
- VAX/VMS
- DECstation/UNIX
- SGI Indigo
- Apollo DN3000 and DN4000
- HP 400 series
- HP 700 series
- IBM RISC System6000/AIX
- ESV Workstation
- Linux

If you have a platform not on this list, you are welcome to join the
beta tester corps! Write TimeTracker-beta-request@uninett.no to get on the list.

NOTE:

As distributed, TimeTracker will send an UDP packet to my workstation every
time it is started, containing your (numeric) UID, your operating
system and the TimeTracker version.

This is JUST because I would like to get an idea of how many people
use TimeTracker, and keep on using it (rather than "tried it once" folks).
It will NEVER become a licensing scheme or some crazy thing like that.
But, if your netadmins hate unknown UDP packets zooming off to unknown
hosts, simply uncomment the following line to the IMAKEFILE:

   CDEBUGFLAGS = -DDO_NOT_TELL_ABOUT_ME

This will not only stop the call, but will drop the whole content of
udping.c, which will also block any errors caused by differences in
the socket implementation.


COPYING, PAYMENT AND SUCH DETAILS

I wrote this program because I needed it. After I released the first
version, I got the feeling that other people may need it too.

You may copy it and modify it in any way you like, the only thing that
can make me mad is if you sell it for real money and do not give me some.

As usual, there is no guarantee about anything at all, and you are not able
to claim that I have done any damage to you by providing you with this
program; any use you make of it is entirely at your own risk.

If you like it, you are free to send me the price of a large pizza
(my favourite costs around NOK 120 / USD 20 around Trondheim).
Or not, if you don't feel like it.
(See the file CONTRIBUTIONS for details)

MAILING LISTS

A lot of people have found bugs in TimeTracker. A lot of people are interested
in further versions, suggestions for new ways to use it and so on.
A few are even willing to do some work to help me test it.

So, I have two mailing lists set up:

   TimeTracker@uninett.no: For general interest
                     Mail TimeTracker-request@uninett.no to join.
                    
   TimeTracker-beta@uninett.no: For testing new versions before I inflict them
                     upon the unwary public.
                     Mail TimeTracker-beta-request@uninett.no to join.

CONTRIBUTORS

Bob Gibson <rjg@sco.com> contributed signal handling.
Taed Nelson <nelson@berlioz.nsc.com> contributed the pause button.
Bruce Steinke <bsteinke@dsd.es.com> contributed the project editor,
      easiest the biggest patch I got!
      He would not recognize the current version, but thanks anyway!
George Carrette <gjc@mitec5.mitech.com> contributed the VMS stuff.
      It is supposed to work on VMS now.
Michael J. Shon <mjs@tropel.gca.com> contributed the TimeTrackerDIR variable.
Mark Rawling <Mark.Rawling@mel.dit.csiro.au> contributed the code
      for displaying the project and used time in the icon name.
Bill Randle <billr@saab.cna.tek.com> made the first icon for TimeTracker,
      and gave me code to produce an icon. Sorry it took so long!
      He also contributed the -minutes and -monthday options to sumtitra.
Grant Totten <ccgwt@blaze.trentu.ca> supplied the current TimeTracker icon.
Mike Gleichner <mkg@stealth.plk.af.mil> made it run on a NEXT
Shane Youl <Shane.Youl@mel.dit.csiro.au> supplied the first multilingual
      version of sumtitra, and most of the non-English, non-Norwegian
      strings.
Gilles Goullet <Gilles.GOULLET@iacorp.fr> supplied some more French
      for the multilingual ability
Per Hallenborg <hbg@vattenfall.se> contributed Swedish text for Sumtitra.
Tim Rosmus <tim@mdd.comm.mot.com> contributed the AutoPause function (it
	only took me 1 1/2 years to get it in there - sorry!)
Jonathan I. Kamens <jik@cam.ov.com> contributed "titrat" and the "startday"
	and "numdays" options to sumtitra, and various other optins
Too many people to list them all pointed out elementary errors in my code
and gave hints for increasing portability.
