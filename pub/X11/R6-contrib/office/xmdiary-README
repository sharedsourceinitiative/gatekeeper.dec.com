XDiary is your personal organizer that combines the functions of 
a desktop calendar, an appointment book and an alarm clock. XDiary 
will help you keep track of your meetings, appointments and plan 
your time.

XDiary is a Motif/X Windows application which allows you to manage 
one or more calendars with a 'few clicks with the mouse'.

XDiary can be used as a stand-alone tool but it also contains all 
the functions necessary to be used as a group calendar. As a group 
calendar, XDiary will help you to plan meetings, distribute information 
to specific groups etc.

XDiary contains the following:

 * A calendar which displays a month at a time.

 * A day view where your schedule for one or more days is displayed. 
   You can easily define, move, change and remove entries. In the day 
   view, you can also include entries from other XDiary calendars.

 * An appointment editor which lets you enter and change appointments 
   or notes. For an appointment, you can define alarms, if it should 
   be repeated, the number of lines to be displayed in the day view 
   etc.

 * A summary window which displays selected appointments and notes from 
   one or more calendars.

 * A print window which lets you print selected parts of your diary 
   on any ASCII or PostScript printer.

 * A reminder window where you can set 'light-weight' alarms.

 * A customize window that allows you to easily customize XDiary to 
   suit your needs.

 * An access control window that allows you to grant or deny other people 
   access to your calendar(s).

 * Various tools that make it easy to write separate programs or scripts 
   that access the XDiary calendars.
