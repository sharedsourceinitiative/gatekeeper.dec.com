Hi,


    Thanks for using "xacursor", the program can:
    1. changes the cursor to the one specified using the "-cursor" option
    2. shows the standard demonstration by the option "-demo"
    3. changes the cursor in the sequence specified in a configuration file,
       so an animated effect is achieved.  The animated cursor can have
       changing colors, and can be animated in different ways.


    A set of bitmaps (they can be made using programs like "bitmap") is needed 
for the animation; with a configuration file, like this:
    [cursor 1]  [mask 1]  [fg 1]  [bg 1]
    [cursor 2]  [mask 2]  [fg 2]  [bg 2]
        .           .        .      .
    [cursor n]  [mask n]  [fg n]  [bg n]

([mask], [fg] and [bg] can be omitted; "NA" is used as place holder.)

e.g. icon/cat1.xbm  icon/cat_m.xbm  red
     ([cursor]= icon/cat1.xbm,  [mask]= icon/cat_m.xbm,  [fg]= red) 

     cat1.xbm  NA  red 
     ([cursor]= cat1.xbm,  [fg]= red;  "NA" is a place holder for [mask]) 


    Once the file (contains only a few lines) is finished, you can start the
animation by "xacursor [the_above_file]".  Some sample bitmaps are in the
directory "aicon"; their config. files are "earth", "egypt", "demo", "dan", 
"neon3", "sheep", etc.  If in doubt, use "xacursor -h" for help.


    You may use "xmkmf" to generate a "Makefile" to compile the program;
or use the standard one "Makefile.std".  The MAN-page is called "xacursor.man".
In addition, this software has been compiled in systems running SunOS, Solaris,
Ultrix, AIX, HP_UX, and Linux using both "cc" and "gcc". 


    To enjoy "xacursor" right away, do:
        xacursor -bg gold1 -fg firebrick -r -demo
    (then go to the root window...)

    you can also try:
        ./xacursor -path aicon -mask earth_m.xbm -fg wheat -bg cadetblue earth
        ./xacursor -path aicon -fg firebrick -bg goldenrod1 demo
        ./xacursor -path aicon dan
        ./xacursor -path aicon -bg lightyellow sheep

    and (these take effect in the root window, due to the "-r" option)
        ./xacursor -path aicon -mask neon3_m.xbm -r neon3
        ./xacursor -path aicon -bg tan -r egypt


    Thanks also goes to Jason Ting (jting@napier.uwaterloo.ca), he suggested me
to provide a better README file (here it is); and has also compiled the
software under HP_UX.


    Please don't be hesitated to give me some suggestions and comments, or
just an encouragement, for every student needs encouragements, right?
