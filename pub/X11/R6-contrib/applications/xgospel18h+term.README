It is the fabulous IGS client xgospel patched for term.  It was tested
under Linux 1.1.45 with XFree86-2.1 and term 1.14, but should work on 
other platforms as well as different term versions.

Before you do xmkmf, make sure to change the path to term directory
from /usr/src/term114 to your own in Imakefile.  For Linux, xmkmf -a
and then make works just fine.
