A "screenhack" for xscreensaver.

MicroSoft(tm) Windows(tm) icons are flying at you, but you've got help
from either Tux the Linux Penguin, the FreeBSD Daemon, a Sun Microsystems
UFO, or the SGI logo, who shoot the Windows(tm) icons out of the sky!

There's also a nice, non-violent "X11" logo mode.

Requires "xscreensaver" ( http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/ ) to compile.
