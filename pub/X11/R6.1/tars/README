This directory contains sources for X11 Release 6.1, public patch 1.

The software release consists of four gzipped tar files:

  xc-1.tar.gz		everything in xc/ that isn't in the other tar files
  xc-2.tar.gz		xc/fonts, xc/doc/specs, xc/util
  xc-3.tar.gz		xc/doc/hardcopy, xc/test
  contrib-1.tar.gz	contrib/

The following files are contained in the tar files, but are also
available separately in this directory:

  RELNOTES.*		Release Notes for X11 Release 6.1
  INSTALL.*		Building and Installing the X Window System
  Manifest.*		R6.1 Contrib Manifest

The following files may aid you in using this FTP directory

  README		this file; a short index of what's here
  CHECKSUMS		checksums of the tar files

The tar files are stored in "gzip" format on our FTP server, and thus
have a ".gz" suffix.  If you cannot handle gzip compression, you can
have our FTP server convert them to "compress" (.Z) or uncompressed
format.  Changing the suffix of the filename you ask for will change
its format on the fly.  Change ".gz" to ".Z" to get compress format.
Remove the ".gz" suffix entirely to get the file uncompressed.

You may examine the file xc/bug-report in your local source tree to
see what public patches have been applied to your X11R6.1 source tree.

After transferring the files, please read the Release Notes and Build
Instructions for information on how to extract and build the software.
