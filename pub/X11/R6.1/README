Here is a road map to the X11R6.1 distribution area:

    tars		core and contrib gzipped tar files, public patch 1
    fixes		public patches to core software
    xc			untarred core software, with all public patches
    contrib		untarred sources to the contrib software
    contrib-fixes	patches to contrib software
    xdm-auth		info about HasXdmAuth config option

The tar files are stored in "gzip" format on our FTP server, and thus
have a ".gz" suffix.  If you cannot handle gzip compression, you can
have our FTP server convert them to "compress" (.Z) or uncompressed
format.  Changing the suffix of the filename you ask for will change
its format on the fly.  Change ".gz" to ".Z" to get compress format.
Remove the ".gz" suffix entirely to get the file uncompressed.

You may examine the file xc/bug-report in your local source tree to
see what public patches have been applied to your X11R6.1 source tree.

After transferring the files, please read the Release Notes and Build
Instructions for information on how to extract and build the software.
