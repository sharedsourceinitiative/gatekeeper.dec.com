9 June, 1994

  Release of version 2.2 patch level 1 

  * Should compile with an ANSI compiler without any warnings
    concerning `promotion' and mismatched arguments. Thanks to  
    Martin Richartz <martin@tk.telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de> 
    for pointing us in the right direction.

  * Compiles correctly on SCO 3.2v4.2/ODT - thank to Daryl Sayers 
    <daryl@stone.oz.au> for telling us what went wrong and what had 
    to be corrected.

  * Configure and compiles (almost) on SGI machines. Thanks to 
    Joe Rehder <joe@vab02.larc.nasa.gov> for taking the time to 
    help us correcting the problems with the Makefiles and 
    header files.

  * compiles correctly on MIPS/OSF (64-bits machine), thanks to
    David Morley <morley@aaii.oz.au> for reporting the problems. 
    These were caused by an incorrect test in the configure script.

  * Converted a few "%d" into "%ld" to avoid problemes on 64-bits
    machine, also fixed a few cast to use long to/from (void *)
    instead of int to/from (void *)

  * Corrected the Makefile(s) to stop upon error in instead of 
    just to continue ..

  * Added comments to README and LINCKS.FAQ concerning linking
    of xlincks under LINUX.

  * Fixed a few uninitialized variables in a few corners of the
    code (lincks/libparser/dbs/cutoff/libxl).

2 June, 1994

  Release of version 2.2

  * Added write access protection on objects by introducting `wgroups'
    file, which enables you to restrict who is allowed to change objects.

  * Support for long long labels added to the database server. You
    can now run the server with 8 byte labels and the clients 
    with 4 bytes labels (default). Small speed up in `dbs' process
    installed, noticable when fetching many objects from server.

  * The program `lincks' returns correct status when starting up a remote
    database as well as extended warning messages. Also, a check for
    a database server already running is peformed.

  * `cutoff' can now handle zero sized images.

  * `dbpasswd' no longer has a name clash with existing getpass
    found on some machines.

  * More extensive error reporting to log files when a user fails
    to log in to the database server.

  * `dbstat' has an extended protocol for exchange with the database
    server.  `dbstat' returns the server version, type of passwords
    (clear text or encrypted) and size of labels in the server (4 or 8
    bytes).  Also, the server hostname can be specified as internet dot
    address and a reverse hostname lookup is done.

  * `dbdump' is now able to dump binary information in images such
    as images, audio, object code etc.

  * `t2lincks' has been extended to support imported binary information
    as generated by `dbdump'. The non-textual information can specified
    as either an uuencodecd string (in the t2lincks file) or read from
    an external file.  Extended the t2lincks language with a `%USER%'
    variable set to current username, thus allowing re-use of t2lincks
    files.  Now returns (1) upon failure and not (0) as before, also
    fixed a small memory leak as well as a bug introduced in release
    2.1 (`t2lincks' never finished if *not* all objects had been
    changed).

  * In `xlincks' we have:
    + Extracted window sizes, font specification, translations into
      fallback resources to allow easier users modifications. Also
      cleaned up the widget names to make it more consistent.
    + Found and corrected the bug with dumping postscript code for
      reference structure and target (press 'Rfnc Strct'), which
      now can be included into documents. Also added popup window
      for specify filenames instead of reading from stdin.
    + Added `-u username -p password' as command line options
    + Fixed the black shading which occured at end of Parallel
      Editing Notifications.
    + Found and fixed bug in `Export' (of LaTeX/text) code causing
      core dumps under HP-UX.
    + You can now compare two different versions of a document 
      (composition) and see which parts that have changed, been
      inserted or deleted. This code has been included in previous
      release, but we have improved the user interface.
    + Added applications resources, allowing the user to specify
      default setting for LaTeX/Text `Export' code.
    + Allowing colors to be used for Parallel Editing Notifications
      and result of `Compare' operations.
    + Applications resources for specifying pixmaps/colors used for 
      Parallel Editing Notifications and `Compare' results.
    + Improved the dumping operation to be able to generate a
      t2lincks file for objects with binary information.

  * David Partain cleaned up the library `libparser.a' and added:
    error message upon stack overflow,  NULLified a few pointers
    and fixed a memset bug.

  * In the library `liblincks.a' we cleaned up the PEN (Parallel
    Editing Notification) interface, added SA_SendAlive function
    (to avoid having the server shutting down an idle, but still
    live connection), and read passwords from /dev/tty (not stdin).

  * Martin Sjölin separated out the networking code into a file called
    tcp.c to make it easier to reuse.  This is now in libshared.a.

  * LINCKS will now compile using either a traditional K&R C compiler or
    an ANSI C compiler.  We have prototyped everything in the ANSI
    manner.  The protos directory contains all of these prototypes.
    Surprisingly, there were no real problems in compiling on an ANSI C
    compiler - even though there is a few small warnings left to
    correct.

  * a good bit of work was done to make LINCKS run on both 32bit and
    64bit machines.  This was in conjunction with porting LINCKS to the
    DEC Alpha architecture.  Ron Young <ron@nevada.edu> did the initial
    work on the port.

  * configuration of the system has been automated with a GNU configure
    script written by Martin Sjölin.  This allows for simpler system
    installation.  Along with this, there has been a good bit of work
    done to make the installation/porting onto other systems as seamless
    as possible. Quite some help from Kent Hamilton  
    (<kenth@hns.st-louis.mo.us>) to get it right on SCO boxes.

  * added support for NEWS-OS 4.2R as donated by Fujimoto Kou
    (fujimoto@titisna.is.titech.ac.jp)

December 20, 1993

  Release of version 2.1

  * added a new utility called dbpasswd, which is used for having
    encrypted passwords rather than straight text.  This was added by
    popular demand.  Written by Martin Sjölin.

  * improved support for SCO machines.  We have no SCO box, so we can't
    test it, but we thank Kent Hamilton (kenth@hns.st-louis.mo.US) and
    Steve Alexander <stevea@lachman.com> for sending us the
    patches/helping with the port.  There are still known problems with
    SCO (notably to do with parallel editing notifications), but it
    should compile and the rest should work.  We'd be happy to hear
    from more SCO users.

  * added support for SVR4.2 boxed using a patch supplied by Martin L.
    Smith (martin@ner.com).  Again, we can't test it, so we'd be pleased
    to hear from other (happy) users.

  * added support for SGI boxes using a patch supplied by Mike Morrison
    (morrison@ccad.uiowa.edu).  Ditto about our ability to test it.

  * fixed some small X bugs thanks to Ralph Ronnquist (ralph@aaii.oz.au).

  * Ralph Ronnquist (ralph@aaii.oz.au) also made some changes to
    t2lincks to make flushing of information easier.

  * Martin Sjölin (marsj@ida.liu.se) was primarily in charge of
    assembling patches and also fixed some stuff for the HP port.  We've
    had a lot of headaches with the HP's and would like to hear from
    users who are either using LINCKS on HP's or gave up.

  * cleaned up the Make.config file a bit.  The next patch will do
    configuration using GNU's autoconf (we hope) to make your life
    easier.

  * added the file LINCKS.FAQ in an attempt to answer questions before
    they are asked :-).  (FAQ means Frequently Asked Questions)

  * made the default EXTRA_DEFINES in Make.config turn off command
    history.  We made this decision since (1) command history isn't used
    yet, and (2) it takes up a fair bit of space.  If you want it back,
    take -DCOMHISTOFF away from the EXTRA_DEFINES in Make.config.

 * did significant trimming on the database which is dumped to create
   the Export.t2l file used in creating the new database at installation
   time (removed partain and rrq objects).

 * code reorganization for our sake which should have no user-visible
   effect.

 * the Export button on windows has added functionality.

 * added translations for raising a window (C-z C-r), lowering a
   window (C-z C-l) and iconifying a window (C-z C-i).

 * Removing an item (M-l M-r - "RemovePlural") now inserts that item
   into the cut buffer so that it can be pasted using the Cut & Paste
   menu.
