	       Announcing Release 2.2 Patch level 1 of
    	LINCKS - a multi-user object-centred database system

What is LINCKS?

	LINCKS is a research database system developed at the
	University of Linkoping in a project to explore the area of
	intelligent information systems.  We are releasing it on the
	net in the hope that we will (1) spark some interest in the
	work we've done, (2) obtain some users and (3) thus some
	feedback which will help us to focus our continued research in
	this area.  Finally, we also hope that our system might prove
	useful for others in their work/research and might lead to
	fruitful research contacts.

	LINCKS is an object-centred multi-user database system
	developed for complex information system applications where
	editing and browsing of information in the database is of
	paramount importance.  The focus is on sharing of small
	information chunks which combine to make up complex information
	objects used by different users for different purposes. The
	information chunks are semi-structured in that they contain one
	part which is well-structured to facilitate addition of A.I.
	processing within the system, and one part which is
	unstructured and suitable for management by the user.

Some of LINCKS interesting features are:

	* Multiple users - LINCKS is a multiuser database system.

	* A hypertext-ish X-windows based user interface to the database.

	* Composite objects - although all objects are built up of
	  small pieces, the user interface presents these as single
	  `composite objects', allowing editing over the entire
	  composite object using an Emacs-like editor.

	* Database history - the LINCKS system maintains information
	  regarding the history of objects and actions within the
	  system.  Object history is maintained at both the single
	  chunk and composite object level. Past versions of objects
	  can be accessed and reactivated.

	* Alternative views - LINCKS allows a user or application
	  developer to interactively define alternative views on the
	  underlying database objects. This is particularly useful in
	  applications where the same information is to be used for
	  different purposes or by people in differing roles which
	  require a different composition and display.

	* Information sharing - LINCKS provides an easy way for users
	  to share database objects or for one user to share
	  information across all of her/his accessible objects.  This is
	  done by linking objects into composition objects.  Thereby,
	  any changes to that object by one user will result in updates
	  to all compositions which have that object as an component.

	* Parallel Editing Notification - As LINCKS is a multi-user
	  system and allows information sharing, this leads to possible
	  conflicts.  Consequently, the LINCKS system maintains a list
	  of objects being edited and issues warnings when parallel
	  editing occurs.

	* Tutorial - The system contains a simple interactive tutorial
	  to illustrate the basic ideas and capabilities of the system.

Availability

	If you are interested in trying out the LINCKS Version 2.2
	system, it is available by anonymous ftp on ftp.ida.liu.se
	(130.236.30.131) in the directory pub/lincks/lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz
	(or pub/lincks/lincks-2.2.1.tar.Z for those without GNU unzip).
	This machine is in Sweden.  If it doesn't allow you in the first
	time, wait a few seconds and try again.

	Note that ftp.ida.liu.se allows very few anonymous (10) ftp logins 
        at one time, so we have made LINCKS available on the following
	ftp sites:

        ftp.sunet.se:pub/unix/databases/object-oriented/lincks/lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz
        ftp.uu.net:pub/database/lincks/lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz
        gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/net/infosys/lincks/lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz
       
	To retrieve it, do the following:
	> ftp ftp.ida.liu.se 
	(log in using anonymous as the username and your 
	 mail address as the password) 
	> bin 
	> cd pub/lincks 
	> get README "|more" 
	> get lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz 
	> bye

	Alternatively, you can pick up the User's Manual in
	PostScript(TM) format (xlincks_manual.ps.gz or
	xlincks_manual.ps.Z) if you want to have a look at the
	Interface user manual.  NOTE!  This file is also included in
	the tar file, so you needn't get both.

	After retrieving the LINCKS tar file, you can unpack it by:

	> cd some-directory 
	> gunzip lincks-2.2.1.tar.gz 
	> tar xvf lincks-2.2.1.tar 
	> cd lincks-2.2.1

	Thereafter, read the README file and the COPYING file, the
	latter of which explains the terms under which you can use
	LINCKS.  LINCKS Version 2.2 is available under the terms of 
	the GNU General Public License version 2.

What you need to run it

	You must have some reasonable sort of UNIX (TM) and X11R5 or
	something based on it.  X11R4 support doesn't really exist,
	although the interface will run.  We hope to fix the X11R4
	support soon, but don't count on it.  Now that X11R6 is out,
	we'll try to get LINCKS available on R6 as soon as possible.

	- Sun 4's, running SunOS 4.1.[1-3], and X11R5.  This is the
	  development platform.

	The rest of these have been tested only minimally and not
	necessarily by us.

	- Sun 4's, running SunOS 5.2 (Solaris), and Solaris' 
	  OpenWindows (based on R5).
	- Sun 3's, running SunOS 4.1.1 and X11R4.
	- DECstations running ultrix and X11R5
	- IBM RS6000's running AIX and X11R5
	- Sequent Symmetry running DYNIX and X11R4
	- Linux 0.99.12 Kernel with X386 1.3 on a 486 box.  There's no
	  reason why it shouldn't work on later versions as well.
	- HP's running HP-UX and X11R5.
	- SGI IRIX
	- SCO Unix
	- PC (386 box) running SVR4.2
	- SONY NEWS NWS-3860 (MIPS R3000 CPU) NEWS-OS 4.2R
	- 4.3 Reno BSD
	- DEC OSF/1 (1.3A) Alpha
	- DEC OSF/1 MIPS

	If you have any of these platforms or any other reasonable kind
	of UNIX, we hope you will be able to get the system running.


Where we can be reached

	We (the developers) can be reached by sending mail to
	lincks@ida.liu.se.  If you have bug reports, please send them
	to lincks-bugs@ida.liu.se.  Additionally there is a lincks
	mailing list (lincks-users@ida.liu.se) for interested parties,
	which you can join by sending mail to
	lincks-users-request@ida.liu.se.
