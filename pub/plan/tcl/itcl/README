[incr Tcl] 3.2.0

The itcl3.2.tar.gz file is the [incr Tcl] snapshot used for
TclPro 1.4.  itcl32.zip is the corresponding ZIP file.
This version is compatible with Tcl 8.3.

The [incr Tcl] home page is

However, currently I can make no guarantee about the
completeness of this distribution.  We build and release
directly from our CVS workspaces as opposed to using
this particular source release.  All this is to say, don't
be too suprised if there are glitches building from this 
release.  Ideally you should be able to use "configure"
and "make" to build for the UNIX platform of your choice.
