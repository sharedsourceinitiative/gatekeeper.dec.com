Scott Lipcon reports:

I have set up a nightly RPM build - its not well tested.  Its a 3 stage 
process via cron (at midnight my user updates via cvs, at 12:30 root 
builds the RPM, and at 1am my user scp's the result to my ftp site).  
Please let me know if you have any trouble.  At 1am eastern each night, 
the daily snapshot will appear at ftp.acm.jhu.edu, in /pub/slipcon, as 
exmh-2.2_yyyymmdd.noarch.rpm.  I will delete old ones manually for the 
time being, so make sure you are grabbing the latest.
