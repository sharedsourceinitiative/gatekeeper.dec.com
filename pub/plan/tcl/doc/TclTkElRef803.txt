Abstract: 
   PDF version version of the Tcl/Tk and [incr Tcl] manuals.  Applies to
Tcl/Tk version 8.0.3 and [incr Tcl] version 3.0.  Only version 3.0.0 of
[incr Widgets] is included (no version 2.2.0).  Document is complete with
nice cover page and thorough table of contents for each section (comments
included). 
Side Comments:
   Built with groff (for nice formatting), existing man pages (this is the
bulk of the work), and a custom indexer that I wrote in Bourne Shell.  That
and a nice copy of Adobe Distiller and Exchange.
