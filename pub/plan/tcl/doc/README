engManual.tar.Z         Compressed tar file for a directory containing
                        the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual, which describes
                        the C coding and testing conventions used to develop
                        Tcl and Tk.  I strongly encourage other Tcl/Tk
                        developers to follow these conventions, particularly
                        if you want to submit code for possible inclusion
                        into official releases.
