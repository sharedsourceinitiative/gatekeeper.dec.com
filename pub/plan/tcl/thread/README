Thread 2.0

ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/thread/thread2.0.tar.gz

This extension provides a thread package for Tcl scripts
that lets you create a new thread with its own Tcl interpreter.
You can then send Tcl scripts to these worker threads for evaluation.
The threading model is explained in more detail in
http://dev.scriptics.com/doc/howto/thread_model.html

To compile this you must first have built a Tclsh 8.3.1 that was
configured with --enable-threads.  E.g., 
	cd ~/src/tcl8.3.1/unix
	sh configure --enable-threads --enable-gcc

    Then configure and compile the thread extention:
	cd ~/src/thread2.0/unix
	sh ../configure --enable-threads --enable-gcc \
		--with-tcl=../../tcl8.3.1/unix

You also use configure and make on Windows - see the
README.txt in the win directory for details.

Note that we are extending the Tcl core support for threads to
allow channels to be passed between threads.  These new APIs
will appear in Tcl 8.4 and the Thread 2.1 version will take
advantage of those capabilities.
