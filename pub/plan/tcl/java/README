This directory contains a collection of files related to Jacl and
Tcl Blend, all of which are available for anonymous FTP.  Below is a
description of what is in the various files in this directory.
See http://dev.scriptics.com/software/java/download.html for more 
information on Jacl and
Tcl Blend and how to download and install them.

Be sure to retrieve files in image mode (type "type image" to FTP)
in order to make sure that you don't lose bits.

Most of these files are compressed tar files;  to get back the
original directory hierarchies, type a command like the following for
each file you retrieved:
		zcat jacl1.0.tar.Z | tar xf -
This will create a directory named jacl1.0 with all the source files and
documentation for that release.  For files with ".gz" extensions, use
a command like the following instead of the one above:
		gunzip -c jacl1.0.tar.gz | tar xf -

Each of the releases has a README file in the top-level directory that
describes how to compile the release, where to find documentation, etc.

Questions or problems with any of these distributions should be directed
to the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup.
